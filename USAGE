                               CFDWARP USAGE

____________________________________________________________________________




1. CREATE TEMPLATE CONTROL FILE

./warp -w control.wrp



2. EDIT CONTROL FILE


Use your favourite editor and edit the control file:

pluma control.wrp

The control file uses the SOAP interpreter language, for which a manual
is provided (see lib/soap/doc). As well, the grid generation is done 
through the GRIDG library (see lib/gridg/doc). Learn how to write 
code in SOAP and how to generate a grid through the examples given in 
the manuals.



3. CHECK THE GRID


At the UNIX shell prompt, execute warp as follows:

./warp -r control.wrp -opg post.grid

Then, verify if your grid is correct in tecplot

tec360 post.grid

Alternately, you can generate a grid in vtk format as follows:

./warp -r control.wrp -opg post.vtk -pt vtk

And visualize the grid in paraview:

paraview post.vtk



4. CHECK THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS


For a 2D problem, you can verify if your boundary conditions are 
implemented correctly through the following command:

./warp -r control.wrp -on 20 25 40

This will output to the screen the node types around the point i=20, 
j=25 with a  bandwidth of 40 nodes. To display the node types in 3D 
around  the point i=120, j=25, k=22 with a bandwidth of 30 nodes, 
the command becomes:

./warp -r control.wrp -on 120 25 22 30

 

5. CHECK THE INITIAL CONDITIONS


The initial conditions can be verified by creating a tecplot 
postfile directly from the control file:

./warp -r control.wrp -op post.01

and then opening post.01 using tecplot:

tec360 post.01

Alternately, you can add the flag -pt followed by either vtk or 
nodplot to create a  postfile in paraview or nodplot format, 
respectively.



6. RUN A CASE


Once the grid, boundary conditions, and initial conditions have been 
verified to be valid, you can run a case as follows:

./warp -r control.wrp -o data.01

This will iterate the case with the boundary conditions, grid, and 
initial conditions specified in control.wrp and output the 
converged solution to the data file data.01. In case of a crash,
lower the CFL within the Cycle() module. 



7. RESTART A CASE


If you wish to restart a case that is not yet converged, this can be 
done with the following:
 
./warp -r control.wrp -i data.01 -o data.02

This tells warp to read the data file data.01 instead of applying the 
initial conditions and to continue the iteration process which will be 
saved in the data file data.02.



8. VISUALIZE THE DATA


The data file can be transformed into a post file that can be read by
tecplot or some other data visualization program through the command:
 
./warp -r control.wrp -i data.02 -op post.02



9. POST-PROCESS THE DATA 


CFDWARP has some built-in functions within the Post() module part 
of the control file to help with data post-processing. For instance, 
using the Post() module, it is possible to find the thrust potential 
or the average stagnation pressure at a certain x-station (such would 
be tedious to obtain using TECPLOT or other post-processing software). 
To run post-processing commands using the Post() module, type the 
following at the shell prompt:

./warp -r control.wrp -i data.02 -opm post.02



10. RUN CFDWARP IN THE BACKGROUND


You may wish occasionally to run warp in the "background" so that it 
continues running even after you exit your shell. To do so,
first figure out which shell you are using by typing at the prompt:

echo $SHELL

If tcsh, then you can run CFDWARP in the background as follows:

./warp -r control.wrp -o data.01 >& scr.01 &

where both stdout (the screen output) and stderr (the error)
are outputted to scr.01. If you want to restart a not-yet-converged
case, rather execute the following:

./warp -r control.wrp -i data.01 -o data.02 >>& scr.01 &

where ``>>'' tells the shell to append to the file scr.01.

On the other hand, if the shell is bash (on linux) or sh (on 
traditional UNIX OSes), then run CFDWARP in the background with:

./warp -r control.wrp -o data.01 1> scr.01 2> scr.error &

where stdout is outputted to scr.01 and stderr is outputted to
scr.error. To restart a case, use:

./warp -r control.wrp -i data.01 -o data.02 1>> scr.01 2>> scr.error &



11. SEND A SIGNAL TO A RUNNING CFDWARP


By sending the signal USR1 to a running warp, warp will save the 
datafile  at the following iteration. For example, the following will 
tell all running warp codes on a machine to save the datafile:

killall -USR1 warp

Alternately, you can send a signal to a specific warp process by finding 
its process ID through top, and then specifying the following:

kill -USR1 PID

where PID should be substituted by the process ID of CFDWARP found through 
top.



12. RUN CFDWARP WITH MPI


If CFDWARP was compiled with mpicc, then the following command 
should be used at the prompt:

mpiexec -np 4 ./warp -r control.wrp -i data.01 -o data.02

The latter shares the work and memory on four processes that will be 
distributed on one machine or on several machines depending on how MPI was 
configured on your server.
       


13. RUN CFDWARP WITH OPENMP THREADS


If CFDWARP was compiled with OPENMP threads, the number of threads can be 
changed to 4 within the shell by typing:

set OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

or

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

Alternately, you can change the number of threads with the -nt flag. Note
that the number of threads specified through the -nt flag supersedes the 
one specified by the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.



14. CPU PROFILING


If CFDWARP was compiled with the CPU profiling option (-pg flag), then run
it as usual and wait for it to finish the job normally (don't kill it
prematurely). This will output the file gmon.out in the local directory.
When warp finishes, it will output a file called "gmon.out". This can be 
analyzed using gprof with the analysis outputted to an ascii file as 
follows:

gprof ./warp gmon.out > analysis.txt

or

gprof -D ./warp  gmon.out > analysis.txt

Gprof will read in the executable and the file gmon.out and output the
CPU profiling information in the file analysis.txt.



15. OTHER COMMANDS


For other commands, see the list of possible flags that warp recognizes by
typing warp without arguments at the prompt:

./warp -h
