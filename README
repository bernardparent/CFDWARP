                                CFD Code for Plasma & Reactive Flow

  _______________________________________________________________________________________________


  CFDWARP is a 100,000+ line C code that is specifically tailored to simulate efficiently plasma 
  and reactive flows occurring in aerodynamics, combustion, hypersonics, and planetary entry. 
  CFDWARP is a high-order compressible flow solver that uses state-of-the-art flux discretization 
  schemes suitable for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Implicit Large Eddy Simulation 
  (ILES). CFDWARP has the unique capability to efficiently simulate the full coupling between 
  non-neutral plasma sheaths and the quasi-neutral plasma flow.

  Please read the file CONTRIB for the list of the CFDWARP contributors.

  Please read the file COMPILE for compilation instructions on a UNIX machine.

  Please read the file USAGE for instructions on how to operate the CFDWARP code.
