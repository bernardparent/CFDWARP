  CFDWARP is a in-house-developed  200K-line C code that simulates efficiently plasma and reactive 
  flows occurring in aerodynamics, combustion, hypersonics, planetary entry, semiconductor 
  manufacturing, and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). CFDWARP is a multi-block structured mesh 
  compressible flow solver that uses high-order flux discretization schemes suitable for Reynolds-
  averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES). CFDWARP is superior to 
  other codes in being capable to integrate the electron and ion equations along with the bulk flow
  equations using aerodynamic-scale (i.e. microsecond and higher) integration steplengths, 
  permitting the simulation of non-neutral plasmas in about the same amount of computing effort as 
  non-ionized reactive flows (see https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054624).
