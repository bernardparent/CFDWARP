help     Choose "none" if the cycle strategy was chosen as "Predictor-Corrector". Otherwise, choose "explicit" for first-order explicit Euler pseudotime stepping, "block ADI" for the block implicit ADI scheme, "block DDADI" for the diagonally dominant version of "block ADI" which provides better high frequency wave damping. The scheme "block IMAF" is an iterative "block DDADI" which becomes a direct inversion in the limit of a large number of subiterations (not compatible with MPI).
