     - implemented a novel way to implement the cross-derivative terms based on
       the upwinded Cauchy_2o time discretization -- as expected, this yields a

       with zetaAd=1.0

     - in find_prim_fluid(), changed the way the mass fractions were clipped

        neutral species -- now, the neutrals, ions, and electrons, are clipped 
        separately)
   * in model/fluid/_Favre-Reynolds_plasma/fluid_plasma.c

2015 OCT 16b
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent_MUSCL/convres.c
     - in _f_cross(), changed the limiter

2015 OCT 15b
   * in src/bdry.c
     - just before function adjust_node_type(), added a #if condition checking that

2015 OCT 15a
   * in model/fluid/_Navier-Stokes/fluid_bdry.c
     - in function _fBC2(), reverted the stencil to pre 15OCT10 version (less compressive)
       --> the more compressive stencil gave convergence hangs in 3D


2015 OCT 14
   * in cycle/_multizone_marching/cycle.c
     - in function runtime_actions_cycle_specific(), fixed a bug: gl->cycle.varphiverge
       should be called with a SOAP_get_argum_double() not SOAP_get_argum_long()
     - in function runtime_actions_cycle_specific(), fixed another bug:
       at the end of the function, find_ximax() should be called with STORE_POS set to
       TRUE not FALSE
   * in model/fluid/_Navier-Stokes/fluid_bdry.c
     - in function is_node_bdry_no_cross(), added the boundary type "0" to the boundaries
       that should have no cross derivatives terms
       --> Need more testing


2015 OCT 13
   * in src/bdry.c
     - in function adjust_node_type(), commented out the last operation
       of turning the corner nodes (in 3D) to outflow
   * in model/fluid/_Navier-Stokes/fluid_bdry.c
     - added function is_node_bdry_no_cross()
       --> turns off cross-diffusion terms on certain types of bdry nodes
       --> needs more testing
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent/convres.c
     - in function _f_cross(), implemented call to is_node_bdry_no_cross()

     - made it simpler, for smoother and easier runs


2015 OCT 05
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent/convres.c
     - in function f_cross_2(), changed algorithm to make sure that all non inner
       nodes obtain their properties from nearest inner nodes
     - deleted find_Fstar_interface_original()
     - in find_Fstar_interface(), now call f_cross_2() instead of f_cross() for
       3D fluxes
       --> fixed a problem encountered when solving ramp injector due to corner nodes
           having much different temperature than other nearby boundary nodes
       --> corner nodes are problematic because their properties
           are copied from near inner nodes rather than treated as other boundary nodes
 

2015 OCT 04
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent/convres.c
     - added function _f_cross_2() which is the same as _f_cross() but has
       the type of node (INNNER or not) as arguments
       --> for now, yields same results as _f_cross()
       --> but can be used later maybe if there are convergence hangs
     - changed CNTBDRYMAX from 0 to 999
       --> now always computes the cross-diffusion terms at boundaries
       --> this seems to be necessary, but needs further testing 
       --> does not lead to convergence hangs (previous observation on OCT 03b was 
           premature and not correct)


2015 OCT 03b
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent/convres.c
     - set CNTBDRYMAX to 0 instead of 4 because it was giving convergence hangs 
       for some 2D problems (in 3D, it was set to 0 already)
      

2015 OCT 03
   * in src/main.c
     - in main(), got rid of "gl.iter=1;" after solution is converged 


2015 OCT 02b
   * in model/fluid/*/fluid_conv.c
     - in function f_Parent_average(), now take the min between the two determinative properties
       instead of a blend between a min function and a geometric average function
       --> leads to fully monotone solutions even when used with a Roe averaging for the
           normal 2nd derivatives
       --> blending a geometric average is not needed anymore to avoid carbuncle phenomenon
           because Parent averaging is only used for the cross derivatives, not for the normal
           2nd derivatives
       --> needs further checking (perhaps this leads to convergence hangs?)


2015 OCT 02a
   * in src/common.c
     - in _zone_intersection(), implemented checks that lead to a fatal_error should no
       intersection be found between both zones

       is at least 3 nodes in each dimension. If not, do a fatal_error()
   * in cycle/res/conv/_FDS_2o_Parent/convres.c
     - in find_jacvars_at_interface_normal(), changed the averaging type from Parent to Roe
       --> for some reason, Parent averaging on the normal 2nd derivatives leads to issues
           in 3D ramp injector problems (perhaps in boundary layer)
       --> needs verification
   * in cycle/ts/conv
     - renamed _FDS_1o to _FDS_1o_Roe
     - added _FDS_1o_Parent


2015 OCT 01
   * in model/fluid/_Favre-Reynolds_plasma/fluid.c

       an average that is a blend of geometric average and min functions

     - when CROSS_DIFFUSION_FACT is set to 0.5, this converges flawlessly on all test cases
       but has somewhat non-optimal resolution for sinewall case
     - when CROSS_DIFFUSION_FACT is set to 1.0, the resolution is optimal for the sinewall

     - in function _mu_interface(), made Te=max( 200K+Tn,Te)
       -> needed for stability

     - in the function update_dU_emf(), added a call to find_dFstar_dUstar_interface_emf()

     - in function _Pk(), added   
       if (spec==speceminus) Tk=4000.0;
     - gets rid of all the even-odd node discoupling which is due
       to the electron temperature function of electric field within the pressure
       gradients within the potential equation
     - need to find a fix for this

2014 JAN 06
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_MUSCL_Multi/convres.c
     - added a second strategy to the multidimensional terms, where the A matrices
       are substituted by some lambda matrices
       (a bit dissipative, but seems to be monotonic at least)


2014 JAN 03
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_MUSCL_Multi/convres.c
     - added MUSCL limiters in 2D -> works relatively good, but a bit too compressive, needs to be attenuated


2014 JAN 02
   * in cycle/res/conv
     - added the directory _Roe_2o_MUSCL_Multi


2013 DEC 31

   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix/fluid_conv.c, prim/fluid/_Favre/fluid_conv.c, prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c
     - renamed FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage() to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage_old()
     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c
     - renamed FindJacVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage() to FindJacVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage_old()

     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Pos/convres.c
     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD/convres.c
     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c
     - changed the call to FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
   * in cycle/res/conv/
     - renamed _Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW to _Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_Pos
     - made necessary modifications to .config and Makefiles
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
     - fixed a bug in Fint: the artificial dissipation term had to be divided by 2


2013 DEC 30
   * in cycle/res/conv/
     - added the directory _Roe_2o_TVD_MUSCL
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c
     - added the function FindMusclVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage()


2013 NOV 05
   * in tools/prandtlmeyer.c
     - inputted an expression for y_ramp=.. as a function of x_ramp, x_lip, y_lip
       (y_ramp and x_ramp can not be specified independently: when x_ramp is user-defined,
        y_ramp must be found theoretically)


2013 OCT 03
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_mix
     - fixed a couple of bugs, seems to run smoothly now


2013 OCT 01
   * in prim/fluid/
     - added the directory _Favre_mix
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_mix
     - copied files from prim/fluid_Favre_mix_vib and edited to take away nitrogen vib. energy flux
 

2013 AUG 05
   * in cycle/res/conv/.config
     - moved _Roe_2o_TVD_Multi to experimental


2013 AUG 02
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Multi/convres.c
     - made modifications so that the flux at the interface corresponds to the sum of the dimensionally-split
       Yee-Roe scheme with the cross terms derived from the Lax-Wendroff technique (from _Roe_1o_Multi)


2013 AUG 01
   * in config/config.c
     - added the function GetOneLetter() which is used as a replacement to GetOneNumber()
       within the function handle_choices()
     - this fix was necessary because there are now more than 9 choices when selecting
       a discretization scheme for the convection terms  
   * added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Multi/



2013 APR 13
   * in src/post.c
     - modified the functions WritePostFile(): added the flag RESUMENODES which is
       set to FALSE when the domain corresponds to a x-cut
     - in functions WritePostFile_VTK(), WritePostFile_Tecplot(), WritePostFile_NodPlot(),
       only call the function ResumeNodesOnlyInZone if the flag RESUMENODES is TRUE
     - this fixes  small bug at the boundary nodes because some boundary nodes can not
       be resumed properly when the domain is one node long
       

2013 APR 05
   * in tools
     - removed sheath.*
     - added cathode.c (cathode sheath 1D theoretical solution)


2012 OCT 07
   * in cycle/ts/_Explicit_Constantdt/ts.c in function UpdateBdryConditions_Nohcase()
     - added the 2D version of the Noh case boundary conditions
     - added the references where the exact solution can be found


2012 OCT 06
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, function ProcessCodeRuntime(), added gl->time
     as the variable "time" to be used within the Runtime() module -- this only takes
     effect when using the time stepping method _TS_EXPLICIT_CONSTANTDT
   * in cycle/ts/_Explicit_Constantdt/ts.c added UpdateBdryConditions_Nohcase()
     - for now, the call to this function can not be triggered from the control file 


2012 OCT 03
   * in cycle/ts/_Explicit_Constantdt/ts.c added gl->time+=gl->dt; to UpdateQtilde() and FinddQ()
   * in src/common.h, added the variable "time" to gl_t when _EXPLICIT_CONSTANTDT is declared
   * in cycle/_Standard/cycle.c, added gl->time=0.0 at the start of the cycle when 
     _EXPLICIT_CONSTANTDT is declared


2012 OCT 02
   * Got rid of the TVD limiters within the time derivative, and made the time
     derivative a conservative first-order backward stencil
     - in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_source.c, took away TVDlimiter2() and TVDlimiter3()
       and altered the function FindSunsteady()
     - in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix_Vib/fluid_source.c, took away TVDlimiter2() and TVDlimiter3()
       and altered the function FindSunsteady()
     - in src/common.h, took away Qtildem2 and Qtildem3 from npbs_t
     - in src/data.c, took away Qtildem2 and Qtildem3 from ReadDataFile_ascii(),
       ReadDataFile_binary(), and ReadDataFile()
     - in src/main.c, in main(), took away -im2 and -im3 flags
     - in src/data.h, took away M2 and M3 boolean variables and name_m2 and name_m3 from input_t
     - in src/test.c, in main(), took away -im2 and -im3 flags


2012 SEP 29
   * in cycle/ts, added _Explicit_Constantdt directory
     - marches in time giving the same time step to all nodes
   * in src/common.h, added the variable dt in the structure gl_t
     to be used with the Explicit_Constantdt strategy


2012 SEP 6
   * in lib/gridg/doc/contruct.tex
     - fixed a mistake related to the 2D example of the ReverseIndex() command


2012 AUG 19
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c:
     - reduced maxloopthread and maxzonethread from 16384 to 256
     - setting it to 16384 creates too many processes that linux can not (yet?) handle
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - added the function FindFint_new() that tests (in 2D) some alternate formulations
       of the multidimensional additions to the Roe flux (so far, none of the alternate
       formulations proved to be as good as the original FindFint()


2012 AUG 13
   * added how to send a USR1 signal in USAGE


2012 AUG 12
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - Further modified the function FindFint() so that the multidimensional contribution
       is not added at the boundary (this is necessary when computing 3D flows for some reason)
     - Modified the function FindAabsfromJacVars(): the eigenvalues are now determined
       by calling the function FindLambdapfromJacVars2() instead of FindLambdapfromJacVars();
       This affects only the eigenvalues on the denominator of the multidimensional terms through zetabar3; 
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c and in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix_Vib/fluid.c
     - in function WriteFluidTemplate() added zetabar3 to the list of user-defined parameters
       Setting zetabar3=0.1 while keeping zetabar1=0.0 results in much improved stability and does not 
       sacrifice on the resolution within viscous layers  
     - in function ReadAndInitFluid_Actions(), added zetabar3 to the variables read from the control file  
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.hh and in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix_Vib/fluid.hh
     - added zetabar3 to jacvars_t and to gl_fluid_t   
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c 
     - added the function FindLambdapfromJacVars2() -- it's the same as FindLambdapfromJacVars() except
       that all the eigenvalues are modified using the parameter zetabar3 
     - Modified the functions FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage() FindJacVarsAtInterface_PosAverage(),   
       FindJacVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage(), FindJacVars(), FindJacVarsFromMusclVars(): added an 
       initialization of zetabar3 right after the initialization of zetabar1 and zetabar2
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix_Vib/fluid_conv.c
     - added the function FindLambdapfromJacVars2() -- it's the same as FindLambdapfromJacVars() except
       that all the eigenvalues are modified using the parameter zetabar3 
     - Modified the functions FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage(), FindJacVars(), FindJacVarsFromMusclVars(): 
       added an initialization of zetabar3 right after the initialization of zetabar1 and zetabar2
        


2012 AUG 11
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - changed maxloopthread from 256 to 16384
     - changed maxzonethread from 16 to 16384
   * in prim/fluid/
     - changed the name of _Favre_Multi_Vib to _Favre_Mix_Vib
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Mix_Vib/fluid.c
     - in the function _ktilde(), changed:
          tmp=max(min(gl->prim.fluid.kdiv,_psi(np)*_mu(np,gl)/_rho(np)), ...
       by:
          tmp=max(min(gl->prim.fluid.kdiv,_psitilde(np,gl)*_mu(np,gl)/_rho(np)), ...
     - this makes the integration more robust in regions where psi is close to zero
       or becomes negative
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - Modified the function FindFint() so that the multidimensional contribution
       is not added at the boundary (this is necessary when computing 3D flows for some reason
       -- need to check into this further)


2012 AUG 10
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - copied convres.c to convres.old2
     - cleaned up convres.c (got rid of the unused functions and variables)
   * in cycle/_Standard/cycle.c, cycle/_Multizone/cycle.c, cycle/_Marching_Window/cycle.c
     and cycle/_Marching_Window_Multizone/cycle.c:
     - in the function WriteCycleTemplate(), took away the (unnecessary) declaration
       of the variable flux
   * in prim/fluid
     - changed the name of _Favre_Multispecies_N2vib to _Favre_Multi_Vib


2012 AUG 09
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_bdry.c
     - deleted the InflowOutflow subsonic boundary condition
     - changed the SubsonicOutflow subsonic boundary condition so that the static pressure
       is fixed (rather than the stagnation temperature)
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - in the function update_Qtilde_from_dQ(), found a bug: when SMALLTHREADS is set to TRUE,
       it is necessary to do a mutex lock when updating gl->effiter_Q when using zone threads
   * in cycle/ts/_Implicit_AF/ts.c, cycle/ts/_Explicit/ts.c, cycle/ts/_Implicit_MAF-DDADI
     - in the function update_dQ(), found a bug: it is necessary to do a mutex lock when updating gl->effiter_Q


2012 AUG 07
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - fixed a bug in the function FindFint()
       (the 2D code used both fluxadd1 and fluxadd2 despite only one of them having been computed)
       (only affects 2D results when using gcc compiler)
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_bdry.c
     - fixed a bug in the function UpdateBdry_SubsonicOutflow()
       (the flow speed at the boundary is fixed to zero if the flow flows away from the boundary
        instead of the opposite as it used to be)


2012 AUG 06
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_bdry.c
     - added the function UpdateBdry_SubsonicOutflow()
       (not tested yet)


2012 AUG 02
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_bdry.c
     - added the function UpdateBdry_InflowOutflow()
     - added the function UpdateBdry_SubsonicInflow()


2012 AUG 01
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - Added the function NodeOffsetFromCnt()
     - Made a modification to the function UpdateBdryNode()
       * when updating the corner boundary nodes, the offset is first set to 0, then to +1, then to -1.
         (previously, the offset was first set to -1, 0, then +1)
       * this fixes a bug in 3D with the boundary nodes located in the corner (the bug was
         that the boundary node properties were not necessarily set to those of the nearest
         inner node, but sometimes set to those of the next-nearest boundary node)
   * changed the way Qtilderef is read in the cycle module:
     - in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c, added the function WriteQtilderefTemplate();
     - in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.c, added the function WriteQtilderefTemplate();
     - in cycle/_Marching_Window_Multizone/cycle.c, 
        cycle/_Marching_Window/cycle.c
        cycle/_Multizone/cycle.c
        cycle/_Standard/cycle.c
       o modified ReadAndInitCycle_Actions();
       o modified WriteCycleTemplate();


2012 JUL 31
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - added a 3D version of the multidimensional FDS method 
       (seems to work fine, but needs more testing)
 

2012 JUL 24
   * in config/config.c
     - added "-e" flag to the "#!/bin/sh" command in the function output_makefileheader()
     - added "-Wfatal-errors" flag to the flags passed to the ICC and GCC compilers in function
       output_makefileheader()


2012 JUL 23
   * added yet another flux approach (#6) in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - works even better than previous approach #5 (very high resolution for expansion fans)
     - has higher resolution than a *second*-order yee-roe scheme for all cases considered
 

2012 JUL 21
   * added yet another 2 new flux approaches (#4 and #5) in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - the latest one (#5) works superbly well


2012 JUL 20
   * added 2 new flux approaches in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
   * added the contravariant velocity function _V() in prim/_prim.h 
     - used only by cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c


2012 JUL 19
   * fixed some issues regarding the metrics Jinv/Omega (it used to be that the code
     would check with asserts if Jinv/Omega was positive -- this is not necessary, as
     Jinv/Omega can be negative and be physically meaningful) 
     - in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c, in function AddDQtoQtilde(), removed an assert 
       checking for Omega>0.0  
     - in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c, in function FindQ(), 
       removed an assert checking for Omega>0.0  
     - in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.c, in function AddDQtoQtilde(), 
       removed an assert checking for Omega>0.0  
     - in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.c, in function FindQ(), 
       removed an assert checking for Omega>0.0  
     - in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c, in function FindMetricsNode(), removed an
       assert checking for Jinv>0.0
     - in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c, in function FindMetricsInterface(), removed two
       asserts checking for Jinv>0.0
     - in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, in function _xi(), removed an assert checking for 
       Omega>0.0
     - in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, in function _xi(), changed the way xi is computed 
       (used to be proportional to fabs(Res)/Omega/Qtilderef, now is proportional 
       to  fabs(Res/Omega/Qtilderef)
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c, in function FindMetricsInterface2();  
     changed assert(sum>0.0e0); for assert(sum>=0.0e0);
   * in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c in function FindMetricsInterface(), everytime
     there was a division by *Jinv, changed to a division by _nonzero(*Jinv)
   * in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c, added the function FindMetricsInterface3(np_t *np, 
     gl_t *gl, long lL, long lR, long theta, long theta2, metrics_t *metrics)
     - this is used by the Roe_Multi scheme (necessary because the metrics.X[dim] at the interface
       is not necessarily X[dim][theta] but is allowed to be X[dim][theta2])
     - also modified prim/_prim.h and prim/metrics/_metrics.h


2012 JUL 18
   * in .makefile-header, changed /bin/sh to /bin/sh -e
     - this will force the shell to exit upon encountering an error
   * there is a bug in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - the lambda matrices are not obtained from the right metrics
     - will fix this tomorrow
 

2012 JUL 17
   * Further modified cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - the scheme remains high-resolution and with very few oscillations


2012 JUL 16
   * Modified cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Multi/convres.c
     - the scheme is now veyr high-resolution but a bit oscillatory  


2012 JUL 14
   * Added Roe_1o_Multi in cycle/res/conv/
     

2012 MAR 03
   * in prim/_prim.h
     - added the function FindJacVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage();
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c
     - added the function FindJacVarsAtInterface_ArithAverage();
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Pos/convres.c
     - added the option for arithmetic average at the interfaces
     - rewrote the function FindLambdaMinusPlus_RoePos() in terms of the matrices Y and Z instead of B and C
       ( the algorithm is the same thus)
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c
     - added the option for arithmetic average at the interfaces
     - rewrote the function FindLambdaMinusPlus_RoePos() in terms of the matrices Y and Z instead of B and C
       ( the algorithm is the same thus)


2012 FEB 29
   * in cycle/_Positive/cycle.c
     - found a bug
     - the loop went through only the first dimension
     - now, made the loop go from 1 to nd


2012 FEB 26
   * found a bug in cycle/ts/_Explicit/ts.c
     - The pseudotime step used to be calculated just prior to the update of the node properties within the same loop
     - this worked fine for all schemes except for the Roe_1o_Pos and Roe_2o_Pos schemes which have
       a pseudotime step function of the nearby nodes
     - now, the pseudotime step is found for all nodes prior to any update of the properties
 


2012 FEB 20
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o/convres.c and in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o/convres.c
     - in function AddConvRes(), made changes to calculate the flux the interface only once
       (used to calculate the fluxes Fm1h and Fp1h at each node; now Fm1h is set to the
        previous Fp1h)
     - in function FindFint(), made all terms function of the metrics at the interface
       (used to calculate F using the metrics at the corresponding node)
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Pos/convres.c and in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_Pos/convres.c
     - in function AddConvRes(), made changes to calculate the flux the interface only once
       (used to calculate the fluxes Fm1h and Fp1h at each node; now Fm1h is set to the
        previous Fp1h)
     - added the capability to use roe averaged properties at the interfaces through the flag ROEAVERAGE
       (additionally to "pos averaged" ones which are used by default)
     - added the capability to use roe eigenvalues (through the flag ROEEIGENVALUES)
       (additionally to the "positive" eigenvalues which are used by default) 


2012 FEB 18
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_Pos/convres.c
     - modified the functions FindLambdaMinus and FindLambdaPlus
       (now the metrics are determined at the interface rather than at the node)
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c
     - modified the functions FindLambdaMinus and FindLambdaPlus
       (now the metrics are determined at the interface rather than at the node)
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c, subroutine FindFint
     - found a bug: FindMetricsInterface was called after FindJacvars which itself
       depends on FindMetricsInterface


2012 FEB 17
   * further improved _Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c in cycle/res/conv
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c, removed the function FindMetricsInterface2()
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_conv.c, removed the function FindMetricsInterface2()
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c, removed the functions Finddtau(), FindGamma(), and FindGammaInv()
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.c, removed the functions Finddtau(), FindGamma(), and FindGammaInv()
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c:
     - added the function Finddtau()
     - added the function FindGamma()
     - added the function FindGammaInv()
     - modified the dunction Finddtau following the non-linear stability condition based on the rule of the
       positive coefficient; i.e., dtau<1.0/(lambdaplus-lambdaminus)
   * in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c:
     - added the function FindMetricsInterface2()
     - added the function FindMetricsNode2()
   * in cycle/res/conv/*/convres.c
     - added the functions FindLambdaMinus() and FindLambdaPlus()
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.hh
     - got rid of the variable delta part of jacvars_t
     - delta was a variable used to test the Pos Average, and was always set to zero 

   
2012 FEB 16
   * Improved _Roe_2o_TVD_Pos/convres.c in cycle/res/conv

 

2012 FEB 15
   * Deleted _Roe_1o_Pos in cycle/res/conv
   * Renamed _Roe_1o_Pos_iter to _Roe_1o_Pos cycle/res/conv
     - _Roe_1o_Pos can be obtained from _Roe_1o_Pos_iter by setting numiter=0
   * Added _Roe_2o_TVD_Pos in cycle/res/conv
     - started the implementation of the Gminus and Gplus matrices 
   
   

2012 JAN 30
   * Renamed _Roe_1o_POS2 to _Roe_1o_Pos in cycle/res/conv
   * Renamed _Roe_1o_POS6 to _Roe_1o_Pos_iter in cycle/res/conv
   * Deleted _Roe_1o_POS* in cycle/res/conv
   * Added a CONVERGENCE flag to _Roe_1o_Pos_iter 
     - doesn't work so well
     - by default, this is turned off
 

2012 JAN 27
   * Added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS7
     - not as good as _Roe_1o_POS6


2012 JAN 26
   * some small changes to cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS6


2012 JAN 25
   * Added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS6
     - is more accurate than Roe_1o_POS5
     - suffers from less convergence hangs than Roe_1o_POS5


2012 JAN 24
   * Added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS5
     - is more accurate than Roe_1o_POS2 
     - suffers from more convergence hangs than Roe_1o_POS2


2012 JAN 19
   * Added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS3
     - doesn't work as well as Roe_1o_POS2


2012 JAN 16
   * in the file cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS2/convres.c
     - improved the Roe pos model 
     - works a bit better than JAN 13 version


2012 JAN 13
   * Added the directory cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS2
     - this consists of a positivity-preserving Roe scheme that introduces little dissipation in
       laminar boundary layers
     - works reasonably well at least for a Mach 2 laminar boundary layer


2012 JAN 03
   * in prim/fluid/fluid_conv.c
     Updated the FindJacVarsAtInterface_PosAverage() function 
     Updated the FindLambdapfromJacVars() function


2011 DEC 30
   * Updated the FindJacVarsAtInterface_PosAverage() function in the file
     prim/fluid/fluid_conv.c 
     - helps at hypersonic speeds but not much at low supersonic speeds


2011 DEC 28
   * in prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid_conv.c
     - added the subroutine FindJacVarsAtInterface_PosAverage()
       o for now, is used within the Roe_1o_POS method)
       o corresponds to arithmetic averaging
   * modified cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o_POS/convres.c
     - now uses FindJacVarsAtInterface_PosAverage() instead of FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()


2011 DEC 26
   * Added the diffusion to prim/fluid/_Navier
     - Renamed the directory prim/fluid/_Euler to prim/fluid/_Navier
     - In prim/fluid/_Navier/fluid.c, put relevant terms within the functions FindK(),
       FindBJacobian(), FinddTdx(), and FindG()
     - in fluid_bdry.c, added the wall boundary conditions
   * Renamed the subroutine BdryFluidZeroSpeed() to SetBdryInterfaceFluxtoBdryNodeFlux() in all files
   * In prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_bdry.c, in subroutine
     SetBdryInterfaceFluxtoBdryNodeFlux(), set the return value to FALSE for all boundaries (used to
     be set to TRUE for the wall boundary conditions)
   * In prim/fluid, deleted the directory _Favre_Multispecies
   


2011 DEC 25
   * fixed the Roe_1o_POS method: now works 


2011 DEC 24
   * in cycle/res/conv/, added the method _Roe_1o_POS
     (needs more work: as it is written, the method collapses to a 1st order SW scheme)
  

2011 NOV 04
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.c
     In the subroutine _mut() and FindPrimMem(, fixed a bug found by Kim Minha: there was a 0.5 factor
     missing within the sqrt here:
     np[l].wk->mut=rho*max(k,0.0e0)/max(psitilde,35.0/12.0*sqrt(0.5*sum)); 
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/doc/Governing_Equations/report.tex
     added the missing \frac{1}{2} within the \sqrt of Eq. (27)



2011 OCT 20
   * in lib/latex/warpdoc.cls, added the option [mtpro]
     - To date, mtpro was specified by default, and this made it impossible to compile the latex 
       documents on machines on which the mtpro2 fonts were not present 


2011 AUG 31
   * Fixed a bug in config/config.c
     - did not accept the choice 'none' when selecting the type of threading
   * in config/config.c, added the choice for icc compiler
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, uncommented #define SMALLTHREADS and #define VERYSMALLTHREADS
     - boosts the performance by 15% or more 
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, subroutine SOAP_fatalerror(), forgot to initialize retval=0
     - this omission used to generate a compiler warning with icc
     - this did not create problems with the code because the code would always exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
       prior to returning retval


2011 AUG 11
   * Fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - in subroutine SolveMultizone, after "Find dQ for inner nodes", took away
        "if (cnt>0) JoinAllThreadsZone(cntthread, pthread, FALSE);"
       and replaced with
        "if (cntthread>0) JoinAllThreadsZone(cntthread, pthread, FALSE);"
   * Added OPENMP threading support
     - added the choice to openmp when doing make config (altered the file config/config.c)
     - added the library -lgomp to the linker options (altered the file src/Makefile)
     - NOTE: so far, no subroutine has been altered for openmp (still working on this)


2011 MAY 25
   * in the file prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_conv.c
     - in the function FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage(), fixed a "bug": 
       took away the lines "kL=1.0; kR=0.0;"
     - took away all calls to zetap variable in jacvars structure
   * in the file prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid.hh
     - took away variable zetap in jacvars structure
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_bdry.c
     - took away function FluidBdryInterfaceCondition(long nodetype)
     - added function BdryFluidZeroSpeed(long nodetype)
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFL/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_1o/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD/convres.c
     - modified the boundary conditions so that:
       o the Roe schemes use a flux at all boundaries dependent on the inner and boundary node
       o the Steger-Warming schemes use a flux at the zerospeed boundaries dependent on the boundary node only
       o the Steger-Warming schemes use a flux at all non-zerospeed boundaries dependent on 
         both the inner node and boundary node


2011 MAY 24
   * Renamed the function AddConvRes1() to AddConvRes()
   * in Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_conv.c, spotted a bug in FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage(). 
     - tmpR=_Omega(npR,gl); used to be tmpR=-_Omega(npR,gl);
   * added the directory prim/metrics/_generic_old (old way of determining the metrics)


2011 MAY 20
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_bdry.c
     - in all instances where PRESERVE_MOMENTUM is in effect, took away the addition
       of the momentum to the pressure at the boundary nodes if BDRYDIRECFOUND is FALSE
     - added the function FluidBdryInterfaceCondition(long nodetype)
   * in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_bdry.c
     - in all instances where PRESERVE_MOMENTUM is in effect, took away the addition
       of the momentum to the pressure at the boundary nodes if BDRYDIRECFOUND is FALSE
     - added the function FluidBdryInterfaceCondition(long nodetype)
   * in prim/_prim.h
     - added the constants FLUIDBDRYINTERFACE_IN, FLUIDBDRYINTERFACE_OUT, FLUIDBDRYINTERFACE_IN_OUT
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFL/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_1o/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o/convres.c
     in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD/convres.c
     - modified the boundary conditions so that the wall BC follows the pre-march-2011 approach
       and the other BCs follow the post-march-2011 approach


2011 MAY 19
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c, modified the 
     function AddConvRes1();
     - added the pre-march-2011 of specifying the flux at the boundary 
     - the pre-march-2011 can be selected by setting BCAPPROACH=1
     - the post-march-2011 approach can be selected by setting BCAPPROACH=2
     

2011 MAY 13
   * renamed the directory prim/fluid/_Favre to prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib
   * fixed a mistake in the document prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/doc/Governing_Equations/
     - in Eq. (37) for chi_w, the sign between the first two terms in the last bracket was wrong
       (in Wilcox's paper, it is "+", but it was written "-" in report.tex)
   * fixed a mistake in the file prim/fluid/_Favre_Multispecies_N2vib/fluid_source.c
     - in the function _chiw(), changed 
       "_dvidxj(np,l,gl,k,i)-_dvidxj(np,l,gl,i,k)-sum2"
       to
       "_dvidxj(np,l,gl,k,i)+_dvidxj(np,l,gl,i,k)-sum2"


2011 MAY 09
   * in prim/fluid/_Favre/fluid_conv.c
     - added function void FindRinvQfromJacVars()
     - added function void FindQfromJacVars() needed by FindRinvQfromJacVars()


2011 APR 23
   * fixed a bug in cycle/res/conv/_Roe_2o_TVD/convres.c in function AddConvRes1()
     - FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage() sometimes used the properties of a node outside of the
       domain
     - this should not affect the solution thus, because the jacvars found from the non-existing
       node were not used afterwards
   * added a check for xi being NAN in the function _xi() part of cycle/share/cycle_share.c
 

2011 APR 20
   * improved the eigenvector sets in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c
   * got rid of some unused variables in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming-2o_TVD_POSFLCW/convres.c


2011 APR 19
   * updated the call to FindQFromMusclVars() in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming-2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
     - now includes variable *gl as a parameter
   * improved the function FindRinvQfromJacVars() in the file prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c
     - now, it performs the matrix multiplication Rinv*Q only if the vector RinvQ is not
       specified explicitly
     - results in less computing work 


2011 APR 18
   * Implemented a new set of eigenvectors in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c (eigenset#6)
     - this set is positivity preserving for xi=1.8 and yields characteristics variables that
       are all non-zero
   * Fixed a bug in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW
     - Did not compute Rinv in FindFplusFminus()
     - This bug was present since incorportating the call to FindRinvQfromJacVars() a couple of
       days ago
   

2011 APR 17
   * made a small change to cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW
     - added a condition  (which is set to TRUE by default) to compute the positivity preserving
       limiter or not


2011 APR 16
   * added a second and third set of eigenvectors to prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c
     - Notes:
       eigenset=1 yields the eigenvectors recommended by mathematica (not positivity-preserving)   
       eigenset=2 yields the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors as those specified in "The Use of
                  Domain Decomposition in Accelerating the Convergence of Quasi-Hyperbolic 
                  Systems, by Parent and Sislian, JCP, 2002 (Positivity-Preserving)
       eigenset=3 is a mix of the eigenvectors of eigenset#1 and eigenset#2
                  (only coded in 2D, and not positivity-preserving)
   * added the following lines in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW:
       for (flux=0; flux<nf; flux++) Gplus[flux]=sign(Gplus[flux])*max(fabs(Gplus[flux]),1e-30);
       for (flux=0; flux<nf; flux++) Gminus[flux]=sign(Gminus[flux])*max(fabs(Gminus[flux]),1e-30);
     - the latter are needed to ensure that Gplus or Gimus are never zero 
       (part of the assumptions in deriving the positivity-preserving method). 
   * added an assertion for Jinv>0.0 in prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c
     (only turned on if runtime debugging enabled)


2011 APR 15
   * fixed a bug in prim/fluid/_Euler/prim_conv.c
     - the eigenvalues in FindLambdapfromJacVars() used to be defined as V,V,V+a,V-a
       instead of V,V,V-a,V+a
     - affects the subroutine FindLambdapfromJacVars() only
   * changed the name of the module WIFANS_kpsi to Favre
     - changed prim/fluid/_Favre/fluid.hh
     - changed src/common.h
   * Added in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid.hh
     #define _FLUID_N2VIB FALSE 
   * fixed some bugs in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c
     - affects 3D algorithms only
     - bug was due to the function _nonzero not always used when determining Rinv in 3D
   * fixed another bug in prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid_conv.c:
     in FindFfromJacVars(), (jacvars.a2/(jacvars.gamma=1.0) is changed to (jacvars.a2/(jacvars.gamma-1.0)
   * In function FindXimax(), added a condition to verify if xi is nan or negative
     - when so, output error message and stop the computing process
   * in file prim/metrics/_generic/metrics.c, added some assertions to check whether
     Jinv is positive or not
 

2011 APR 14
   * fixed a potential bug in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c
     - affects the function void UpdateBdryPrim()
     - added the line npC=np[l_C]; after  FindPrim(np,l_C,gl);
     - necessary eventhough npC was previously set to np[l_C] because 
       the metrics on node l_C were updated since then
   * in src/test.c, in function Roeaverage_test(), added a screen output
     "init. cond. must be discontinuous between (ie-is)/2+is-1 and (ie-is)/2+is"
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - added the variable *gl to the call parameters of several functions (_P, _T, _Hbar,
       etc) that were redefined recently
     - renamed the function POST_Pstar() to POST_P()
   * further improved subroutines in prim/fluid/_Euler/


2011 APR 13
   * Further improved the Euler fluid module in prim/fluid/_Euler
   * made changes to src/post.c (because gl is now part of the arguments 
     of the functions POST_P, POST_rho, etc)
   * made changes to src/post.c: now, the computing of the plasma
     global properties (lorentz force, heat, work done, etc) is only
     done if _FLUID_PLASMA is defined in fluid.hh
   * fixed as bug in src/control.c: when _FLUID_MULTISPECIES was not defined
     in fluid.hh, the first comment was not closed correctly when writing the
     "dummy" control file
   * in src/test.c, took away the calls to FindH() and FindDjacobian()
     - these functions were only used for testing purposes in fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - because they were taken away from test.c, these functions are not used anywhere 
       anymore
 

2011 APR 12
   * Further improved the Euler fluid module in prim/fluid/_Euler


2011 APR 11
   * Further improved the Euler fluid module in prim/fluid/_Euler


2011 APR 08
   * Improved further the Euler fluid module in prim/fluid/_Euler


2011 APR 07
   * Improved Euler fluid module in prim/fluid/_Euler/
   * added Euler module variables in npwk_t structure in src/common.h


2011 APR 06
   * Started working on the Euler fluid module
     -> created directory prim/fluid/_Euler
     -> edited file prim/fluid/_Euler/fluid.c
     

2011 APR 02
   * changed the way the entropy correction is applied to the eigenvalues. Now, the entropy
     follows the one outlined in the paper "Positivity-Preserving Flux-Limited Method for Compressible
     Fluid Flow", B. Parent, CAF, 2011
     -> affects file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c


2011 MAR 12
   * in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_MUSCL/convres.c, added the superbee and the van-leer limiters
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c, changed the boundary conditions for the symmetry
     and the wall boundary nodes
     -> now, the algorithm is such that the wall pressure is never less than 1/10 of the pressure
        at the near wall node


2011 MAR 11
   * in prim/thermo/_NASA1996/thermo.c and prim/thermo/_perfect/thermo.c, modified
     the functions dskdT_from_T(), sk_from_T(), Tv_from_ev(), ev_from_T(), Tv_from_ev()
     -> implemented a different ev vs Tv function, so that ev is linear with Tv for Tv<Tvlim
        with Tvlim=200K or so. 
     -> gets rid of Tvmin clipping problem when it is less than 30K 
   * in cycle/res/conv/*/convres.c, changed the way the flux is determined at the interface
     between the near boundary node and the boundary node. 
     -> flux used to be fixed to the flux at the boundary node
     -> flux is now determined using a first-order 3-point-stencil method (S-W or Roe scheme)
     -> this ensures that positivity is preserved at the near boundary node at least for the
        S-W methods
   * in prim/fluids/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c, added rhov^2/2 to the pressure at the wall and
     at the symmetry planes
     -> This ensures that no flux goes through the wall/symmetry boundaries while being
        positivity-preserving
   * in cycle/ts/conv/_Roe_1o/convts.c, changed the linearization coefficients of the near
     boundary nodes to make them compatible with the new flux discretization approach 
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, made modifications to the functions _tauvt()
     and FindSvib()
     -> now, when setting N2VIB=NO in the control file, the nitrogen energy source terms
        are set to zero
     -> previously, when setting N2VIB=NO, the nitrogen energy source terms were such that
        the vib. temperature equalled the bulk gas temperature
  

2011 MAR 10
   * in file prim/thermo/_NASA1996/thermo.c, added the variable Tvibmin=30.0. Tvib needs to be 
     limited in some functions to prevent NaN
     - modified function ev_from_T(double T)
     - modified function devdT(double T)
     - modified function sk_from_T()
     - modified function dskdT_from_T()
   * added perfect gas thermodynamics module in prim/thermo/_perfect
     - only three species have been included: electrons, O2 and N2 
   * took away unused subroutines in cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_1o/convres.c
   * in cycle/res/_generic/res.c, added function FindResidualperDimension()
   * took away subroutine FindA2jacobian from ./prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c
   * took away subroutine AddConvRes1 from cycle/res/_generic/res.c
   * in cycle/ added the "positive" cycle


2011 MAR 09
   * added the POSFLCW scheme to cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFLCW
   

2010 OCT 28
   * Decreased the order of accuracy of the Steger-Warming MUSCL scheme
     (instead of using a limiter that is as close to second-order accuracy as possible, 
      switched back to a minmod limiter)
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
   * Decreased the order of accuracy of the Steger-Warming Flux-limited TVD scheme
     (instead of using a limiter that is as close to second-order accuracy as possible, 
      switched back to a minmod limiter)
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD/convres.c
   * Decreased the order of accuracy of the Steger-Warming Flux-limited POSFL TVD scheme
     (instead of using a limiter that is as close to second-order accuracy as possible, 
      switched back to a minmod limiter)
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_POSFL/convres.c
   * Modified the POSFL scheme: now further limits the limiter for positivity-preservation
     by taking into consideration only the density and energy fluxes (used to be that 
     all fluxes would be taken into consideration, but this results in too much dissipation)


2010 OCT 27
   * Increased the order of accuracy of the Steger-Warming MUSCL scheme
     (instead of using a minmod limiter, now uses a limiter that is
     as close to second-order accuracy as possible, while resulting in a flux
     at the interface located in-between the left and right fluxes)
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL/convres.c
   * Increased the order of accuracy of the Steger-Warming Flux-limited TVD scheme
     (instead of using a minmod limiter, now uses a limiter that is
     as close to second-order accuracy as possible, while resulting in a flux
     at the interface located in-between the left and right fluxes)
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD/convres.c
   * Added a new flux discretization schme called Steger-Warming-TVD-POSFL
     in cycle/res/conv/
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, deleted _xi() function
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, in the function ReadAndInitFluid_Actions(),
     took away all reads to reference constants used to determine xi
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, in the function  WriteFluidTemplate(),
     erased all reference constants used to determine xi
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, added function _xi()
   * in cycle/_Multizone/cycle.c, 
        cycle/_Marching_Window_Multizone/cycle.c,
        cycle/_Standard/cycle.c
        cycle/_Marching_Window/cycle.c
     in function ReadAndInitCycle(),
     read Qtilderef[] constants from Cycle module  
   * in cycle/_Multizone/cycle.c, 
        cycle/_Marching_Window_Multizone/cycle.c,
        cycle/_Standard/cycle.c
        cycle/_Marching_Window/cycle.c
     in function WriteCycleTemplate(),
     added the Qtilderef[] default constants to Cycle module
   * in cycle/_Multizone/cycle.hh, 
        cycle/_Marching_Window_Multizone/cycle.hh,
        cycle/_Standard/cycle.hh
        cycle/_Marching_Window/cycle.hh
     added Qtilderef[] to gl_cycle_t


2010 SEP 25
   * Made a small modification to the document 
     prim/emfield/_Epotential/doc/Non_Neutral_Plasma/goveqs.tex


2010 AUG 03
   * The following bug fixes only make a difference when calling the functions
     GRIDG_ReadGrid1DFromFile(), GRIDG_ReadGrid2DFromFile() and GRIDG_ReadGrid3DFromFile(). 
     Those functions are not called within warp, but are only called within 
     lib/gridg/eg/tecgrid2D.c and lib/gridg/eg/tecgrid3D.c
     - in file lib/gridg/1Dbase.c
       added line "codex2.filename=codex->filename;" in function RXGrid1D();
     - in file lib/gridg/2Dbase.c
       added line "codex2.filename=codex->filename;" in function RXGrid2D();
     - in file lib/gridg/share.c
       added line "codex2.filename=codex->filename;" in function RXaction2();
     - in file lib/gridg/3Dbase.c
       added line "codex2.filename=codex->filename;" in function RXGrid3D();


2010 JUL 31
   * in directory prim/chem
     - renamed _AIR_7s_... to _AIR_PLASMA_7s..
     - took way warnings about some variables not being used 
     - no "bugs" were found
     - the code output should not be affected
     

2010 JUL 30b
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c
     - took away artificial wind and steger warming specific functions
   * made small changes to numerous files in src, prim, cycle, and lib 
     - took away all the warnings about not checking the return value of fscanf
     - took way warnings about some variables perhaps not having been initialized properly
     - no "bugs" were found
     - the code output should not be affected


2010 JUL 30
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - added Twmin, and Twmax in control file (min and max wall temperature)
       -> Twmin is needed when using the 2008 wilcox k-omega model and adiabatic wall condition
     - added evref and Eref in control file (to determine xi)
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c
     - added the function ReformatTv() 
       -> to clip the vibrational temperature properly
     - everywhere ReformatT() is called, ReformatTv() is also called
   * In prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, function FindPrim()
     - uncommented ReformatT()
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c, function UpdateBdryWall()
     - fixed Tvwall to Twall in case of N2VIB=NO in control file
     - added a clip to Twall and Tvwall so that they remain within the bounds
       specified in the control file through Twmin and Twmax
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, function _tauvt:
     - changed tauvt=tauvt/10000.0e0; to tauvt=tauvt/1000000000.0e0; when N2VIB=NO in control file
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, function FindCtnorm:
     - changed the linearization of the psi flux (added dependence on chiw)
       -> only affects the convergence behavior of the 2008 wilcox k-omega
   * in prim/chem
     - added the directory _H2_AIR_3s_0r


2010 JUL 22
   * Fixed a bug in src/bdry.c, subroutine AdjustNodeType()
     - set to UNUSED all bdry nodes that have no inner node as a neighbor prior to setting
       to outflow the bdry nodes that have only one inner node as a neighbor


2010 JUL 02
   * in src/post.c, improved the subroutine WritePostFile_VTK() 
     - now, the vector variables (i.e. v, E, B) are grouped together
   * in src/main.c, added the option vtk to -pt flag
   * in src/bdry.c, in the function WriteBdryTemplate();, commented out
     the Cut() and the Region() commands
     - makes it more intuitive when editing the control file for the first time
   * in prim/emfield/_Epotential/emfield.c, renamed the post variables j_x, j_y, E_x, etc
     to j[0], j[1], E[0], etc 
     - now, the j,B, and E vectors are properly recognized as vectors by the WritePostFile_VTK()
       function part of src/post.c
   * in prim/emfield/_Epotential/emfield.c, fixed a bug in the function WriteEmfieldTemplate()
     - Only affects 3D solutions
     - Template used not to output js and je in 3D
   * in prim/ebeam/_Fixed_Beam_Energy/ebeam.c, fixed a bug in the function WriteEbeamTemplate()
     - Only affects 3D solutions
     - Template used not to output js and je in 3D
   * in the file src/bdry.c, subroutine AdjustNodeType(), changed the boundary nodes located in 3D
     corners from "unused" to "outflow"
     - such a definition is more convenient for the post-processing subroutine WritePostFile_VTK()  
     - WARNING: NEEDS FURTHER CHECKING
   * in the file cycle/share/cycle_share.c, updated the function *UpdateBdryNode()
     - put a fatalerror() if the boundary node cannot be updated
     - WARNING: NEEDS FURTHER CHECKING

2010 JUL 01
   * in file src/post.c implemented the subroutine to create a postfile in VTK format
     (compatible with the paraview and mayavi2 viewers)
  

2010 APR 22

     - improved the section concerning the assumption of negligible ion inertia change
       compared to the ion pressure gradient 
     - improved the section concerning the assumption of negligible ion inertia change
       compared to the electric field force


2010 APR 21
   * in file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/Favre_averaging/report.tex,

2010 MAR 28
   * In file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, changed the formulation of the electron heat
     addition to the total energy equation and the vibrational energy equation: now, 
     the functions _ElectronHeat and _kei (part of emfield.c) are not used anymore. Rather, the
     electron heat is computed from the electric field in the electron frame of reference
     directly in fluid_source.c
   * In the file prim/emfield/_emfield.h, took away the function calls _kei and _ElectronHeat
     which are not used anymore elsewhere within the prim/ directory 
   * In file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, in function _nustar, changed code so that
     nustar for the electrons is calculated only if speceminus >= 0
   * Set relaxfact_phi directly in cycle module (instead of within the EmfieldEpotential() module)
     - in file prim/emfield/_Epotential/emfield.c: 
       * took away the relaxation from the function EEF_AddDQtoQetilde() 
       * and took away the relaxfact_phi from the control file module in the function WriteEmfieldTemplate();

       * added the function WriteCycleEmfieldTemplate();
     - in files cycle/_Multizone/cycle.c, cycle/_MarchingWindow_Multizone/cycle.c and cycle/Standard/cycle.c
       * added a call to WriteCycleEmfieldTemplate(); within WriteCycleTemplate();  
   * In file prim/emfield/.config, moved _Epotential_Te to experimental 


2010 MAR 27
   * In the directory prim/emfield, create the subdirectory _Epotential based on
     _Epotential_Te
   * Modified files within prim/emfield/_Epotential and took away everything related
     to the electron energy transport equation
   * Modified src/common.h and added some np.bs variables for the _Epotential emfield solver
 

2010 MAR 26
   * Fixed bug in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c in function _a();
     - Findc had to be called prior to using c
   * Fixed bug in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c in function FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage();
     - v[] was used instead of jacvars->v
   * Took away some variable declarations within prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
     (variables that are not used anymore and that created a warning at compile time)
   * In the directory prim/emfield, moved all the epot methods that are deprecated
     to the old subdirectory (they used a simplified two-species model of the plasma to
     calculate the tensor conductivity) 


2010 FEB 02
   * Added the species Helium (He) in prim/thermo/_NASA1996/thermo.c
     and in prim/thermo/_NASA1996/thermo.hh
   * Added the Helium-Air Species Composition in 
     prim/chem/_He_AIR_3s_0r/


2010 FEB 01
   * Added the function EXM_InvMat in the library lib/exm/exm.c


2010 JAN 26 
   * Changed the file lib/latex/warpdoc.cls
     - modified the top margin so that the class file can be used equally
       well for a4paper and letterpaper


2010 JAN 22
   * Changed the order of the linked libraries in src/Makefile
     so that gcc can now compile with the -static flag correctly
     - the -lm flag had to be put after the -pthread flag
   * added units to Reynolds number, x, and y/yplus in file tools/bdry.c


2010 JAN 18
   * Fixed a typo in the document prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/Favre_Averaging


2010 JAN 17
   * Modified again slightly the warpdoc.cls class file part of the directory
     lib/latex/


2010 JAN 16
   * improved the latex class file lib/latex/warpdoc.cls
     - changed margins so that the generated documents look good for letterpaper 
       size and A4paper size
   * Modified all report.tex that called warpdoc
     - deleted the calls to \DeclareMathSizes (now part of warpdoc.cls)
     - deleted the options [10pt,letterpaper,oneside] (now defaults to 
       A4paper,10pt,oneside within warpdoc.cls)
   * In the function ReadControl() part of the file src/control.c, fixed 2 BUGS
     which gave many warnings when checking the memory allocation with valgrind:
     - added gl->nn=99999999999: we need to set gl->nn to a value prior to 
       ProcessCode or gl->effiter_R will not 
       be updated correctly in the function  update_Res() part of the file res.c 
       when called by the cycle module PRIOR to the first iteration
     - moved   pthread_mutex_init(&(gl->lock), NULL); prior to the call to
       SOAP_ProcessCode(): this is necessary since some threading may occur PRIOR
       to the first iteration when the Cycle action is read from the control file
   * In the directory prim/ebeam, created a subdirectory _None and created
     the files /prim/ebeam/_None/ebeam.c and /prim/ebeam/_None/ebeam.hh
   * In the directory prim/ebeam, renamed _fixedQbeam to _Fixed_Beam_Energy

 
2010 JAN 15
   * changed all latex documents to use the warpdoc class
   * changed all report.tex files to be compatible with the mtpro2 fonts
   * put the mtpro2 package in lib/latex 


2010 JAN 14
   * Changed the name of WARP to "Weakly-ionized Airflow Resolver and 
     Post-processor" in the file README and in the logo 
     lib/latex/warplogo.eps
   * Improved the documents in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc
   * Improved the documents in prim/metrics/doc
   * Improved the documents in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, modified the function
     FindStComp():
     - changed St[ns+nd+2]=Omega*xi_star*rho*k*sqr(psi)*fMt to
       St[ns+nd+2]=psi/ktilde*Omega*xi_star*rho*k*eps*fMt
       for OMEGA1988 and OMEGA2008 models (not a bug, just a small change to keep
       the C file in sync with the latex document in doc/Governing_Equations
     - changed St[ns+nd+2]=-Omega*rho*psi*sum; to St[ns+nd+2]+=-Omega*rho*psi*sum;
       for the rapid compression model by Coakley (BUG! in the past, by selecting
       the rapid compression turbulence correction, the dilatational dissipation
       contribution turbulence correction to the omega transport equation was 
       cancelled)
   * in the files prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c and prim/emfield/_none/emfield.c, and
     prim/emfield/_emfield.h, added the function EEF_FindSigma() yielding the
     sum of the ion and electron conductivities
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, in the function
     FindStMHD(), uncommented out the relevant code and also changed
     the terms so they are in sync with those outlined in the document 
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/Governing_Equations (i.e., the Kenjeres and Hanjalic
     correction is now valid for both the 1988 and the 2008 k-omega models)
   * in the file prim/emfield/_none/emfield.c, added the functions
     FindEfield() and FindBField() which both return zero values for the electric
     and magnetic fields
   * in the directory prim/emfield/_none, took away the subdirectories doc and doc2
     (not needed since they are the same documents as found in prim/emfield/_Epot)
   * added the axisymmetric theory document by Jason Etele from warp-nomhd to
     the directory prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc


2010 JAN 13
   * in the file cycle/res/conv/_Roe_1o/convres.c, in the function FindFint()
     changed the call to FindF rather than FindF2. FindF2 was
     used temporarily only on 2010 JAN 12 and is now deprecated
   * fixes to many latex documents 
     - they now almost all use the warpdoc.cls as opposed to the previous
       (ugly) ProReport.cls 


2010 JAN 12
   * in the file cycle/ts/conv/_Steger-Warming_1o/convts.c
     - commented out the exact linearization at the near boundary nodes
     - the exact linearization is not recommended in this case since not all 
       the discretization coefficients are positive
     - commenting out the exact linearization at the near boundary nodes
       results in a more stable scheme at higher CFL
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, changed the fluid variables 
     control file template defaults 
     - altered function WriteFluidTemplate();
   * in the file src/post.c, function WritePostTemplate(), took away
     the file WriteInitTypes();
     - only necessary to know the init types if using the extranode functions
     - Now unnecessary due to the extranode functionality having been taken away


2010 JAN 11
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, changed the call from _mut(np,l,gl)
     to np[l]->bs.mut in the functions _nustar, _mustar, _kappastar, _kappaevstar,
     when using the primmem variables
     - decreases the CPU time a little
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c, changed the wall and electrode
     boundary conditions for the OMEGA2008 model: they are now fixed to those 
     outlined in the original paper by Wilcox (AIAA J. 1988). 
     - results in much more accurate turbulent boundary layer profiles for a coarse mesh
   * included the modification to the OMEGA2008 model in the tex file
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/Goveqs/report.tex 
   * in the function WriteFluidTemplate part of file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c,
     changed some default values for cmin, Pmin, kdiv, etc..
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_init.c, in the function
     WriteInitTypes(), added the suggested value of omega in the freestream 
     for the 2008 k-omega model (psi=omega=110)
   * in the files cycle.c part of the standard, multizone and marchingwindow-multizone
     methods, changed the default values as follows:
     - sigma=0.0
     - IMPLICITBC=FALSE;
     - CFL=min(CFL*1.1,1.0);
   * in the files part of the directory prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/, renamed
     ROE_zetabar1 to zetabar1 and ROE_zetabar2 to zetabar2
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, changed function _dvidxj():
     - made modifications so that at the boundary nodes, only the derivatives of the
       velocity not perpendicular to the boundary plane are considered


2010 JAN 10
   * almost finished the implementation of the Wilcox 2008 k-omega model
     - lots of changes to the files in the directory prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/
   * FindPrimMem is now called with *np and l instead of np in order to 
     be able to compute the 2008 wilcox k-omega version of mut as a mem variable
     - this required the change of many files in src/, cycle/ and prim/
   * in the file src/post.c, got rid of the extranode function part of the post module
     (it was necessary to get rid of this functionality due to mut now depending
     on the properties of the neighboring nodes in FindPrimMem)
   * added the flag variable PRIMMEM in np_t, in src/common.h
     - np.PRIMMEM is set to TRUE after the FindPrimMem has been called
     - np.PRIMMEM is now the flag used instead of the function _NodeResumed to
       determine whether to use the primitive variables stored in memory or not
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c, in the function
     FindJacVarsAtInterface_RoeAverage()
     - used to determine jacvars->dPdx by creating a node, calling the function
       FinddPdX on the created node, and then disposing the node
     - now, no new node is created/disposed. Rather, jacvars->dPdx is found directly
       from the primitive variables 

2010 JAN 08
   * in the latex file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/Goveqs/report.tex, added
     the 2008 Wilcox k-omega model


2010 JAN 06
   * now computes metrics->X2 in function FindMetricsInterface2 part of file
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c
   * in file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c added the functions
     - FindMusclVars()
     - FindQFromMusclVars()
     - FindJacVarsFromMusclVars()
   * in the directory cycle/res/conv/, added a MUSCL-like TVD Steger-Warming scheme
     called _Steger-Warming_2o_TVD_MUSCL (the limiter is applied to the
     primitive variables and the fluxes are reconstructed on the left and right sides
     of the interface)
   * fixed a bug in file cycle/res/conv/_Steger-Warming_2o_TVD/convres.c
     - function _nonzero() is added and used to prevent a division by zero
       within the flux limiter


2010 JAN 05
   * Took away the function FindLambdaFromJacVars in file
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c since the same function existed
     under a different name (i.e. FindLambdafromJacVars)
   * Renamed FindLambdaFromJacVars to FindLambdafromJacVars in all files
   * in the directory cycle/ts/conv: 
     - renamed _Roe to _Roe_1o
     - added convection implicit time stepping terms for Steger-Warming
       scheme in sub directory _Steger-Warming_1o

     - renamed _AF to _implicit_AF
     - renamed _MAF-DDADI to _implicit_MAF-DDADI
     - renamed _MAFk to _implicit_MAFk
     - fixed a few compile-time bugs in files _MAF-DDADI/convts.c and _MAFk/convts.c 
       related to obsolete function calls 
     - moved _implicit_MAFk to experimental within the .config file
   * in the directory cycle/res/conv:
     - added a 2nd order accurate flux-limited TVD Steger-Warming scheme
       (named _Steger-Warming_2o_TVD)


2010 JAN 04
   * Made some changes to file cycle/ts/_explicit/ts.c 
     - changed the call to function FindGammaInv
     - changed the call to function Finddtau
     (the functions ask for *np, gl, and l instead of the previous np[l] and gl)
   * in the files prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c, prim/_prim.h and several files
     in the cycle/ directory
     - renamed functions ROE_??? to ???fromJacVars
     - renamed the variables roe?? to jacvars??
   * in the directory cycle/res/conv:
     - renamed _Roe to _Roe_1o
     - renamed _YeeRoe to _Roe_2o_TVD

   * in prim/chem/_air7sneutral/chem.c, fixed a bug (increased the memory size of 
     several arrays so that no bad memory reading/writing occurs)
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.hh, took away NEUTRAL from gl_fluid_t
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, took away the line starting with

     the line involving _hydrogen... and replaced with the line
     involving _jachimowski...

2007 FEB 17
   * changed double _Te() to include T as an input parameter in 
     prim/emfield/_emfield.h and prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c
     - necessary when initializing the primitive variables at
       the beginning of the cycle


2007 JAN 19
   * added new integration variable in "bodyforces" part of src/post.c
     - sigmaeff, averaged with the current magnitude and area
     - modified src/post.c, prim/emfield/_Epot, prim/fluid/_WIFANS_KPSI


2006 OCT 25

2006 JUL 27
   * removed XDMAthreads subroutines in lib/exm/exm.c
   

2006 JUN 24
   * changed the boundary condition for Tv in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c
     to make it adiabatic even when the temperature at the wall is fixed
   * changed ambipolar diffusion in prim/thermo/_mcbride2002/thermo.c so
     that the the factor (1+Te/T) is applied only to the positive ions 
   * changed lib/exm/exm.c and removed the fprintf(stderr,"E"); and 
     fprintf(stderr,"S"); prior and after solving the XDMA
            

2006 APR 30 
   * changed src/post.c so that the electromagnetic efficiency gets
     written to the file EMefficiency.txt
   * changed the way the calc.c in lib/soap/eg program works - should the 
     flag -nocr be used, then no carriage return is inputted at the end

   * fixed a few bugs in the files lib/soap/eg/*.c
   

2006 MAR 17
   * modified the file prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c so that 
     _ElectronHeat() returns the equilibrium value of the Joule heating
     when TELOCAL is set to TRUE. Note: this only makes a significant
     difference when the electron temperature is equal to the gas temperature
     or when the electron temperature is at its minimum value.
     

2006 MAR 16
   * modified the Psig data in the prim/thermo/_mcbride2002/thermo.c file so that
     the diffusion coefficient of O2+, N2+ and O2- matches the one
     obtained from the mobility at 300K
      

2006 FEB 27
   * modified the subroutine FindSem in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_KPSI/fluid_source.c
     - turn off the electromagnetic source terms when the inner node
       touches a boundary node
     - necessary as the solution might grow unstable near
       a boundary node
     

2006 FEB 25
   * modified the subroutine prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c
     so that the constants relaxfact_Telocal and relaxfact_phi
     are user-specified in the control file
     

2006 JAN 20
   * modified the subroutine EEF_UpdateQtilde in
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c so that the time marching
     procedure is performed only for the extra elliptic
     fluxes that are needed to be solved.
     - this required also some fixes in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c
       through the addition of the subroutine 
       EEF_TimeMarchingMethod(long fluxe, gl_t *gl);

     
2005 NOV 15
   * Added the option of one input parameter in the WriteDataFile
     routine part of the Runtime module in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     

2005 NOV 14
   * a few changes to cycle/share/cycle_share.c and src/main.c 
     - when the solution is converged, the number of iterations
       is set to 1
     - ximax can be varied in the runtime module
     

2005 OCT 23
   * made changes to src/post.c so that the nodplot postfile in 2D
     only includes one k-plane instead of two
     

2005 OCT 13
   * Lots of changes in the last month since coming to Japan
     - fixed several issues in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c
       to tackle domains in which some nodes are not fluid
        

2005 AUG 25
   * a few changes 
     - added oxygen and nitrogen dissociation to the chemical solver
       prim/chem/_air7sneutral
     - added effect of electron/ion pressure gradient to prim/emfield/_Epot
       + note: the generalized ohm's law is correct, but some changes
         to the ion/electron heating in the electron energy transport
	 and the vibration and total energy transport equations are still
	 necessary
     - in the file prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c, subroutine EEF_FindS,
       probes the electron number density as the minimum of the nearby
       nodes in order to determine the source term to the electron
       energy transport equation
       (to prevent some unstability from developping)
     - in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, subroutine
       FindSchem, probes the electron temperature as the minimum
       of the nearby nodes to determine the chemical source terms
       (to prevent some unstability from developping)
   * code seems to work very well for a neutral plasma

   
2005 AUG 07
   * added ambipolar diffusion to charged species in prim/thermo as 
     specified in section 2.6 of Gas Discharge Physics by Raizer
   * improved electron energy transport equation in prim/emfield/_Epot
     so that delta is a function of the temperature
   * changed the chemical reaction rates in prim/chem/_air7sneutral
     so that the townsend ionization is a function of the electron temperature,
     and not the reduced electric field
   * in prim/chem/_air7sneutral, changed the derivative of the townsend  
     ionization source terms so that they don't include the positive source
     terms related to the electron species
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, fixed the derivative dTedQ
     to zero
     - note: this needs to be fixed instead in prim/emfield
     

2005 AUG 01
   * lots of changes again
     - added a new chemical solver _air7sneutral which does not
       include the electron species
     - the latter required changes in the files prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/
     - implemented additional chemical reactions in _air7sneutral
       to take into account O2 and N2 dissociation when the gas
       temperature is in excess of ~2400K and ~3300K respectively
       

2005 JUL 20
   * lots lots of changes which I haven't documented in the last 6 weeks
   * of greater importance:
     - in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, a new discretization algorithm for
       the cross diffusion terms of the extra elliptic equations is
       implemented (based on some upwinding strategy)
     - in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi, changed a few files to make sure
       that the electron continuity equation is not solved: rather, a
       source term is implemented to make sure the gas is neutral
     - in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c, implemented a second flux
       solving for the electron energy    


2005 JUN 04
   * modified lots of things in the last month..
     - changed completely the method in prim/emfield/_Epot
       * fully generalized Ohm's law for any type of weakly-ionized
         plasma (neutral and non-neutral, x number of species..)
       * wrote a new document for the Ohm's law in directory doc2
       * stores the current vector and electric field vector in memory
     - modified several files in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
       * added some accurate derivatives for the case of determining
         the electric field in the electron frame of reference at a constant
	 current
     - added a 3-species low-T air chemical solver in which there's
       townsend ionization and some sort of dissociative recombination
       * much faster than other low-temperature air chemical solvers
       * for testing purposes only..
       

2005 APR 24
   * modified the boundary condition at the cathode for the ion continuity
     equations in the subroutine FindA2Jacobian in the file
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c
      

2005 APR 23
   * a few bug fixes
     - in cycle/res/ and cycle/conv, the subroutines solving for A2jacobian
       had a bug in them and did not revert to 1st order backward correctly
     - in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c, in the Celectron subroutine
       the faction was not used (as it should be) to multiply the 
       ion source term jacobian
     - in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c, in the subroutine FindK, sigma was not
       properly determined
   * in file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c, made a modification to
     the FindA2Jacobian subroutine for the ions: A at the anode is set to
     zero 
   * in the file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c, subroutine dtau, changed
     the way the electron time step is determined (made it smaller than for
     the ions and neutrons)
   * in file prim/chem/_air8s13r/chem.c, added townsend ionization for higher
     reduced electric field: upto 250E-20 V m^2
   * in file prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c and file 
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_conv.c, made the ion continuity equations
     in the standard way, without a modification to maintain div(E)=rhoe/epsilon
     which is guaranteed by the modified electron continuity
   * the solver seems to work great now, maintaining the divergence of the
     electric field equal to the net charge density precisely at all nodes
           

2005 APR 20
   * alright! the plasma sheath solver seems to work now: 
     - it solves for the townsend ionization, coupled with mass diffusion
       and the solution of the modified electron and ion continuity
       equations to ensure that div(E)=rhoe
     - also, muen, Te, and muin have been put as a function of the
       electric field once more
     - the current continuity equation (aka generalized ohm's law) is
       modified to take into account electron and ion diffusion
   * Notes:
     - need to add townsend ionization chemical reactions for higher
       electric field
     - need to add electron energy transport equation   

       
2005 APR 19
   * added diffusion coefficients for electrons and ions in 
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c
     - plasma sheath seems to work but some discretization
       issues when the mesh is clustered as well as at the boundary
       nodes 
     - note: is diffusion necessary to make the sheath exist?
     - at this stage, only the electron continuity equation is modified
       to ensure the divergence of the electric field corresponds to
       the net charge density, while the ion continuity is solved
       normally
       

2005 APR 17
   * added a fix in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_plasma.c in determining
     the electric field needed by the chemical solver: it is now determined
     as a function of the current, which is fixed until the next
     emfield iteration
     

2005 APR 14
   * improved the document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
     - included a proof that the ion inertia can be neglected when the
       electron number density is less than 10^(-6), at least
       when the pressure is greater than 0.1 atm
   * small changes in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi to the file
     fluid_conv.c: now, only the electron continuity is modified
     to ensure that div(E)=rhoe/epsilon
     

2005 APR 13
   * made a modification to cycle/share/cycle_share.c:
     - in the subroutine EEF_UpdatePrimMem(), does not use
       SweepWith1Dsegments anymore
       

2005 APR 12
   * the plasma sheath solver seems to be working
     - now, the electric field potential equation is solved (doesn't
       take more computing than fixing the current, anyway)
     - the electron continuity is solved exactly
     - the ion continuity is modified to ensure that the div(E)
       is equal to the net charge density over the permittivity
     - still struggling with the boundary condition at the cathode
       though
     

2005 APR 11
   * the plasma sheath solver is almost, almost working
     - we dropped the technique converting the electron continuity
       continuity equation into an equation for divE=rhoe/epsilon
     - rather, the electron continuity is solved as before, but by
       modifying the additional convection term and making it only
       a function a derivative of muen*ne instead of E*muen*ne
     - seems to work pretty good, except that it is not exact from
       the point of view of the discretized equations. We'll do this
       tonight. Time to commute through the D&R canal.
       
     
2005 APR 10
   * a few bug fixes
     - in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c -> the boundary condition
       for the electrodes is fixed to a slip wall for the time being
     - in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c -> xi for the ions was not
       properly determines
       

2005 APR 09
   * a few changes which I think will yield a more robust solver
     at the cathode boundary
     - now, the source term which is responsible for ensuring that
       div(E)=rhoe/epsilon is put in the electron continuity equation
     - the boundary condition for the cathode is such that only
       a fraction of the ion flux goes through with the other ions
       accumulating at the wall
   * the next step is to find a proper time step (tau) for the electron
     continuity equation such that the electron number density does not
     become negative in the iterative process
     

2005 APR 07
   * a few changes in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi and prim/emfield/_Epot
     and the code is very robust now to solve non-neutral plasmas
     with a fixed current:
     - put muin and muen as a function of the electric field again
     - implementation of electrode (cathode & anode) boundary conditions
     - new boundary conditions for the ions and electrons at the
       cathode and anode 
       + at the cathode, the electron number density
         is fixed 
       + at the anode, the ions number densities are fixed 
       + all other number densities are extrapolated so that their normal
         derivative to the wall is zero
       + the anode and cathode boundary conditions are treated implicitly
     - the current is fixed for the time being (ohm's law is not solved)
     - the continuity equations for all charged species are determined
       correctly, EXCEPT for the N2+ species, where two additional source
       terms are present: div(E) and -echarge*(Nplus-Nminus)/permittivity
       + the latter source terms are multiplied by Omega*muinrhoion
       + muinrhoin is fixed to 1.0e-4
   * some changes to cycle/res/_generic/res.c and cycle/ts/share/ts_share.c
     - the A2jacobian terms are multiplied by a spatial variation of Omega
       to ensure that the discretization scheme does not introduce some
       errors on highly stretched meshes
       + now, it seems to behave "like a control volume scheme" for the electron
         and ion continuity equations even on highly stretched meshes
   * notes: 
     - need to implement physically "more correct" cathode and anode boundary
       conditions 
       + it seems that the derivative of the electric field perpendicular to the
         anode/cathode should be set to zero
     - need to solve for the generalized ohm's law and store the current until
       the next EEF_iteration
     - need to change the generalized Ohm's law so that it is valid in the non-neutral
       region in the presence of a magnetic field as explained in the document
       prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
     - need to make a fix to the Epot solver so that the current is fixed through
       one electrode pair, as opposed to the potential difference
       + should result in much faster convergence of the fluid flow properties 
         through the plasma sheath
       
	 
2005 APR 03
   * in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_plasma.c, the electric field
     is now found with a fixed current through ohms law
     - converges great!
   * WARNING: in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_plasma.c , muin
     is not a function of the electric field anymore: caused some
     convergence problems
   * WARNING: in prim/chem/_air8s15r/chem.c, the reaction rates
     creating O2- are turned off   
     - NEED TO CHANGE IT BACK EVENTUALLY
   


2005 APR 02
   * the electron and ion continuity equations have been
     modified to incorporate a source term related to divE as
     outlined in prim/emfield/plasmasheath/doc
   * the boundary conditions for the ions and electrons 
     have been modified accordingly in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_bdry.c,
     BUT in a non-general way 
   * in short: new changes  
     - seem to work great
     - can obtain a plasma sheath in a robust way even
       at high electron number densities
     - next, try fixing the current rather than the electric field
     

2005 MAR 30
   * modified the plasmasheath doc part of prim/emfield
     - obtained some electron and ion continuity equations
       that seem promising
       

2005 MAR 29
   * some playing around in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi and
     prim/emfield/_Epot to determine a good solution for a plasma
     sheath by solving div(E)=rhoe/epsilon correctly
   

2005 MAR 28
   * made the electron diffusion term a function of the current in 
     _nuk subroutine part of prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid.c
     - seems to give reasonably good results so far for the plasma
       sheath, but still more work needs to be done at the cathode
       and anode boundaries for velectron and vion.
     - more work needs to be done to find the current as it is now
       user-specified  
       

2005 MAR 24
   * further improvements to the file prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
     - things seem to be looking good for the electron continuity
       - a diffusion term is added
       - a boundary condition is suggested for the electron number
         density
       

2005 MAR 23 
   * some changes in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc for the electron and ion
     continuity equations
   * other small changes elsewhere to the electron and ion convection
     and source terms and to emfield.c in prim/emfield/_Epot
   

2005 MAR 21
   * made a change in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_plasma.c
     -> added the subroutine _Eeffbulk() which is used only
        to determine the electric field needed by the chemical
	solver
     -> WARNING: in _Eeffbulk(), set magEeff=1.0e-40; so
        that the chemical source terms don't depend on the electric
	field: otherwise, these seems to be a stability problem
	somewhere: needs to be checked
   * added information about which variable is clipped in prim/_generic
     - neatly done this time
     	

2005 MAR 20
   * some changes to prim/emfield/_Epot/ to take into account
     the non-neutral  electric field potential equation. 
     

2005 MAR 19
   * lots of changes once again in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - fixed _muen and _muin subroutine
     - added velocity correction terms for the electron and ions
       in fluid_conv.c
   * added second convection residual and ts in cycle/res  and
     cycle/ts
     

2005 MAR 18
   * lots of changes in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi to implement the new
     lorentz force and joule heating function of the electric field only
     - starting to look real pretty, finally!
   * changes in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc to incorporate the ion mobility
     as a function of temperature and electric field
     - need to ask sergey a question about whether this is valid or not
   * changes as well in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c to use mui and mue
     instead of ken and kin (much cleaner)
     

2005 MAR 15
   * got rid of the definitions _CHEM_SPECO, and _CHEM_SPECEMINUS in prim/
     - now, it only checks whether specO and speceminus are defined: cleaner
     

2005 MAR 12
   * document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc is almost finished for a weakly
     ionized gas
     - still need to write the electric field potential equation section
     

2005 MAR 11
   * fixed the zeta_13 equation in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
     - ion and electron joule heating are always positive
     - consistent formulation
   * however, still an issue with the vionweak equation
     - would this still hold near an insulator where the ion velocity
       is zero?
   * fixed a bug in the exact form of equation zeta_15 in
     prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
            

2005 MAR 10
   * much more progress on the electric field potential equation document
     in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
     - problem was with zeta_13 equation


2005 MAR 06
   * created a new directory prim/emfield/_Epotneutral
   * improved the document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
   * improved the document in prim/emfield/_Epotneutral/doc
   * made a warp logo in lib/latex 

   
2005 MAR 02
   * improved the document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc

   
2005 MAR 01
   * improved the document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
   * I think I figured out the stability problem with the em source
     terms: 
     - must fix to a constant Qbeam/N instead of Qbeam
     - also look into linearing the jcrossB terms
     

2005 FEB 28
   * modified the document in prim/emfield/_Epot/doc
   

2005 FEB 27
   * renamed the module prim/chem/_air8s13r to _air8s15r since
     two new reations were added related to the ebeam
   * fixed all jacobian derivatives in prim/chem/_air8s15r
   * fixed the module prim/chem_kerosene19s24r to take into
     account the new format of the chem.c modules
   * added a source jacobian in prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/fluid_source.c
     for FindSem
     - does not make a big difference, unfortunately
   * got rid of the function _ElectronMobility and replaced it
     by _ken
     
     
2005 FEB 26
   * fixed remaining bugs in the jacobian-needed derivatives in 
     prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi
   * some changes to prim/chem/_air8s13r
     - added reactions 7a and 7b to take into account Qbeam
     - wrote down the reactions explicitly one by one
     - updated the doc for reactions 7a and 7b
     
     
2005 FEB 25
   * restructured the prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi directory and added
     a file fluid_plasma.c 
     - added several derivatives in fluid_plasma.c to compute the
       chemical jacobian

       
2005 FEB 23
   * made some changes to prim/chem and prim/fluid/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c
     to tackle the new analytical derivatives of the chemical
     source terms

     
2005 FEB 20
   * lots of modifications to src/init.c and src/bdry.c
     so that the fluid action is read in the control file
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning
     the VNN number which was not read before the EEF was
     computed in the runtime module
     

2005 FEB 18
   * huge changes to prim directory with new subdir fluid
   * fixed prim/chem/_hydrogen9s21r 

   
2005 FEB 17
   * added some docs to prim/chem/_air8s13r and _air15s76r
   * added some doc to prim/ebeam/_algebraic
   * upgraded the doc in prim/emfield/_Efieldpot/doc
   * moved prim/chem/_lutz and _singh to prim/chem/old
   * renamed prim/chem/_jachimowski to prim/chem_hydrogen9s21r
   * changed the call of the functions to prim/chem/_chem.h:
     - now  only has FindW as a function of (T, Tv, Te, rhok) 
     - and FinddWdx which returns dWdT, dWdTv, dWdTe, dWdrhok
     - much, much cleaner
     - WARNING: still need to upgrade prim/chem/_hydrogen9s21r
       and prim/chem/_kerosene/19s24r
   * fixed bugs in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c
     - the residual is now updated in the entire window
       after the extra elliptic flux is computed
     - the extra elliptic flux is now not computed
       prior to the first iteration
   * made a change to cycle/_multizone/cycle.c
     - the extra elliptic flux is not computed prior to the first 
       iteration
   * reorganized the directory prim/ebeam so that the module
     ebeam.c does not return a source flux, but just the Qbeam
       
       
2005 FEB 16
   * took away all the coding related to qbeam in the prim/chem/* files
     - put it in one place in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c
   * changed name of _Efieldpot directory part of prim/emfield to
     _Epot. 
   * added the mcbride nasa paper to prim/thermo/_mcbride2002/doc
   * added a clip for Efieldstar in prim/emfield/_Epot/emfield.c   
     - can be set in the control file, with the name Efieldstarmax 
   * modified substantially the file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, so that
     should the node not be resumed, no working variables are used when
     the functions _T(), _mut(), _P(), etc, are called.
     - NOTE: need to do the same to prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim.c
   * added a new directory in prim called ebeam
     - with subdirectory _algebraic
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, as well as in the c files in
     prim/ebeam and prim/emfield concerning the soap codex variable whose
     action pointer needed to be set back to its original pointer
   * took away kv from the electron impact reactions in 
     prim/chem/_air8s13r/chem.c
   * put the directories prim/chem/_air10s19r and prim/chem_air4s0r in prim/chem/old
     - took away the calls to these directories in prim/chem/.config
       and prim/chem/Makefile
           
   
2005 FEB 15
   * changed the Cvib subroutine in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c
     - does not include the linearization of the terms which include evzero
     - WARNING: perhaps this is good for the stability/robustness of the
       method, but will result in slower convergence (NEED SOME TESTING)
   * in the module prim/_WIFANS_kpsi, included Tvmax a clip for vibration energy
   * in the module prim/_WIFANS_kpsi, fixed a bug related to how ev was clipped
     by Tvmin
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, took away the call for EEF_UpdatePrimMem()
     from EEF_UpdateQtilde(). Rather EEF_UpdatePrimMem() should be determined
     after the Boundary conditions are applied, part of the subroutine
     RuntimeActions when executing the action IterateEEF
     - this fixes a bug which used to occur when reading in a datafile,
       and obtaining the wrong flow residual near the boundary nodes
   * added some warnings/reminders in prim/thermo/_mcbride2002/thermo.c everywhere
     that the data for the species was guessed
   * Find a typo in the FindK subroutine part of prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c concerning
     one diffusion coefficient term associated with the nitrogen vibrational energy:
     - used to read K[ns+nd][specN2]+=_nustar(np,gl,spec)*_ev(np)*alpha;         
     - is now: K[ns+nd][specN2]+=_nustar(np,gl,specN2)*_ev(np)*alpha;      
   * Implemented a new air chemical solver named "air8s13r" in prim/chem
   * In the subroutine Findj part of prim/emfield/_Efieldpot/emfield.c, added
     a clip on the current, as defined by jmax in the control file
   * made the call to EEF_K how it used to be prior to feb 08.
             
     
2005 FEB 14
   * huge changes in the prim directory:
     - took away all the subroutines related to the electric field potential
       from prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - created a new subdirectory in prim called emfield (electromagnetic field)
       which takes care of determining the electromagnetic properties which
       can be used by the prim module
     - rearranged the PrimWIFANSKPSI() control file module: emfield is now
       an action being read an executed as part of the Prim.... module
     - also made changed to the files in prim/FANS_kpsi  
   * REMINDER: 
     - how about getting rid of ReadInitThermo in prim -> useless
     - how about getting rid of ReadInitChemActions in prim??
   * changed substantially the way that the emfield module works
     - now, after updating the electric field potential, it finds the
       electric field vector and stores it at every node.
     - from the stored electric field and magnetic field and the conductivity
       determined from the fluid properties, a current is found.
     - note that this does not affect the way the electric field potential
       is determined, but affects the value of the current when found from
       the Findj subroutine
     - should it be needed in the future, the previous Findj subroutine was renamed as
       Findj_from_interfaces
   * the modules src/init.c and src/bdry.c were modified considerably so that
     the initialization of the extra elliptic fluxes in the control file is done
     totally independently of the initalization of the fluid flow fluxes
     - neat looking! 	


2005 FEB 13
   * updated the manuscript in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/OhmsLawNeutral
	

2005 FEB 11
   * fixed all (I hope) latex files so that
     - hangcaption.sty is not called
     - psfig.sty is not called
     - the figures using {SCfigure} are now using simply {figure}
     - NOTE: this is necessary since the LaTeX included with Debian does
       not recognize hangcaption.sty or psfig.sty
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_eef.c, changed the way betae, betai and 
     sigma are evaluated at the boundary nodes on TYPELEVEL_BASE (i.e., 
     on the boundary nodes adjacent to the flow inner nodes, betae, betai, 
     and sigma are set to the value found on the inner nodes)
     

2005 FEB 10
   * in files part of prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/, made the following changes:
     - in the control file, betaesolid and betaisolid are now used.
       instead of betaeprimesolid and betaiprimesolid
     - in the control file, now we use Jouleheatmax to limit the amount of
       joule heating, instead of limiting the current as was previously done
     - in the control file, added the constant rhoeminusref, which is used
       in determining _xi(): this helps ensure that the electron mass fraction
       continuity equation is solved with enough precision
     - in the subroutine _Te, _T() is not called directly anymore, since this
       subroutine is used by the elliptic field potential equation which
       can be applied even when the node is not resumed (the node needs to be
       resumed in order to apply _T)
     - took away betaiprime from the post variables
     - replaced betaeprime by  betae in the post variables


2005 FEB 09
   * added the variables sigmasolid, betaisolid, and betaesolid as part of
     the contorl file module primWIFANS_kpsi
     - those are assigned to all non-flow nodes (including all boundary nodes)
   * fixed a bug in prim/thermo/_mcbride2002/thermo.c: nuk for the species with
     0 atoms had undefined value. Now, it is set to zero.
   * added the files prim_eef.c and prim_eef.h and put into them all subroutines
     relevant to the elliptic field potential
     - now, after computing a new electric field potential, all terms affecting
       the fluid flow equations (joule heating, lorentz force, electron temperature)
       are stored in memory, and not altered until the next update of the
       electric field potential.
   

2005 FEB 08
   * implemented electron mobility coefficient subroutine as a function
     of the reduced electric field in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
   * implemented _betaeprime(), _betaiprime(), and _sigma() functions
     in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c s a function of the reduced effective
     electric field
   * got rid of the initialization of sigma, betaeprime, and betaiprime
     in the subroutine WritePrimTemplate(FILE **controlfile), and
     also took away the variables betaeprime, betaiprime, and sigma
     in src/common.h
   * changed the call to EEF_K in prim/_prim.h, which required
     changing all c files in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi as well as
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - WARNING: THIS WAS NOT NECESSARY
   * changed the function _etav() in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c to be
     dependent on the reduced effective electric field
   * changed the Makefile in prim/chem/_kerosene19s24r/Makefile
     so that cleanall would not look into the doc directory
   * moved old unnecessary documents in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc
     to old directory 
   * added subroutine void EEF_UpdatePrimMem(np_t *np, gl_t *gl, zone_t zone);
     in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - it calls at every node EEF_FindPrimMem(np_t *np, gl_t *gl, long l);
   * src/init.c was modified to call EEF_UpdatePrimMem at the end of the init module 
     in the control file
     - WARNING: DOES THIS WORK FOR BOUNDARY NODES AS WELL?? IS IT NEEDED?    
   * cycle/share/cycle_share.c was modified so that EEF_UpdateQtilde  calls
     EEF_UpdatePrimMem 
   * added the electron temperature to the post variables in
     prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_post.c  
   * modified the files chem.c so that they call _Te() for the electron temperature


2005 FEB 07
   * implemented the electron temperature _Te subroutine in 
     prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c
   * changed the name of the function SpeciesMolWeight
     to _MolecularWeight

   * renamed the module prim/chem/_airlowtemp to airlowtemp2
   * added airlowtemp1 which is the first chemical solver of
     low temperature air implemented with 10 species and 17 reactions

     and airlowtemp2
     

2005 FEB 05
   * added 5 species to module prim/thermo/_mcbride2002
   * changed the chemical model to 65 reactions in /prim/chem/_airlowtemp
   * added some documentation to prim/chem/_kerosene19s24r from Jason 
     Etele's thesis
   
   
2005 FEB 03
   * Implemented 17 reactions in the module prim/chem/_airlowtemp


2005 FEB 02
   * renamed the _hightemp thermo module as _mcbride1993
   * created the Mcbride2002 module in prim/thermo/_mcbride2002
   * added 10 species to the mcbride2002 module
   
   
2005 JAN 24
   * finished altering the document in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/doc/Efieldpot:
     - culd be further generalized for a non-neutral gas though
     

2005 JAN 22
   * altered the document in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/doc/Efieldpot:
     - made the derivation cleaner and more general
     - still needs some work though
      

2005 JAN 07
   * in cycle.c files part of multizone, marchingwindow_multizone, standard,
     and marchingwindow cycles, added the line "IterateEEF();\n" in the 
     WriteCycleTemplate() subroutine 
   * in cycle/_marchingwindow/cycle.c, modified subroutine PerformOneIteration()
     and made it similar to what is now done in cycle/_marchingwindowmultizone/cycle.c
     -> only significantly affects the gl->CONVERGED flag
     -> NOTE: not sure this is alright or not
     -> NEEDS TESTING
   * in cycle/_standard/cycle.c, modified the subroutine PerformOneIteration()
     -> took away the distributed memory algorithms related to the EEF
     -> won't work well with distributed mpi if using EEF, NEEDS FURTHER MODIFICATIONS
   * in cycle.c part of multizone and standard cycles, added EEF first iteration
     part of the ReadAndInitCycle() subroutines
     

2005 JAN 05
   * in src/main.c, added code to take care of the new option -cr (CheckResidual)
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, added the subroutine CheckResidual() to verify
     the maximum ximax of the extra-elliptic-equation as well as the fluid flow
     equations


2005 JAN 04
   * in the file prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim_source.c, altered the subroutine EEF_FindS
     and set the S term to zero as it used to be prior to WARP 2004 NOV 08 
   * took away sidecap.sty from lib/latex
   * in   prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/doc/Efieldpot/report.tex
     and  prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/doc/Favre-Averaging/report.tex, 
     and  prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/doc/MHD/report.tex
     took away \include{hangcaption} and \include{psfig}   
   * in  prim/_FANS_KPSI/doc/Favre-Averaging/report.tex, 
     and prim/_FANS_KPSI/doc/Handbook/report.tex,
     and prim/_FANS_KPSI/doc/Performance/report.tex,

   * in prim/thermo/_perfect/doc/report.tex took away \include{hangcaption} and \include{psfig}   
          

2004 DEC 28
   * changed cycle/share/cycle_share.c and cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c
     cycle/_multizone/cycle.c so that the update of the extra elliptic flux can 
     be done in the control file as the user desires


2004 NOV 15
   * Changed the license due to departure from SNU
   * modified the file cycle/_standard/cycle.c to include the constant
     phi1 (the Extra elliptic equation is computed every phi1 iterations)
   * modified the file cycle/_multizone/cycle.c 
     - included the computing of the extra elliptic equation
     - added the constant phi2  
      

2004 NOV 10
   * added the directory prim/chem/_airlowtemp which for now has no
     chemical source terms
   * added the constants specN2 and specO to each chemical solver part
     of prim/chem


2004 NOV 08
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim_source.c concerning jmag and Bmag
     having the potential to be equal to zero in the subroutine
     FindSmhd()
     - added 1.0e-30 to both to prevent a division by zero later on
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim_source.c, took away the subroutines
     EEF_xibardiff and EEF_UpdateSourceLinkAtNode
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c took away the subroutines EEF_FindMinis() and 
     EEF_UpdateSourceLink()
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim_source.c, remade the subroutine EEF_FindS
     as it used to be (uncommenting the important lines)


2004 OCT 06
   * some changes to src/common.c and src/bdry.c to ensure that the
     module _FANS_kpsi still works after the modifications done
     adding the extra elliptic flux


2004 SEP 26
   * still further modifications to the subroutines related to the
     left/right eigenvectors and eigenvalues as well as the flux
     jacobian matrix in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c
     - necessary due to the addition of the nitrogen vibration energy flux
     - the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, flux Jacobian matrix have been
       verified to be correct 


2004 SEP 23
   * lots of changes to files in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/ in order to
     accomodate the nitrogen vibrational energy flux
   * changes also in prim/thermo/_hightemp/thermo.c to take away the
     equilibrium nitrogen vibration energy
     

2004 JUL 23
   * added a jmax clip in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c

   * changed cycle/_sweepingcycle_multizone/cycle.c to get one sweep
     for one exact iteration of the EEF
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning the work
     allocated to the different zones for the fluid flow equations
     being dependent on the EEF ximax
     

2004 JUN 18
   * changed cycle/_standard/cycle.c back to how it was before june 15
     - now solves the fluid flow at all iterations
   * modified cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c
     - got rid of the existing method of coupling the EEF with the fluid
       flow equations
     - simplified greatly the approach taking advantage of the exact
       inversion of the EEF
       

2004 JUN 16
   * finished implementation of xdma in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * changed the boundary condition for insulated extra-elliptic nodes from

2004 JUN 15
   * in cycle/_standard/cycle.c, changed the subroutine performoneiteration
     so only the extra elliptic flux is solved
   * started the implementation of a direct inversion solver with xdma for the
     extra elliptic flux in cycle/share/cycle_share.c


2004 JUN 14
   * fixed some bugs in insulated boundary conditions: the terms of the
     electric field potential equation depending on findsigmatilde are
     rewritten as a function of findsigmatildeinterface, which is set to zero
     at the interface to an insulated BC
     - affects only files in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/ directory


2004 JUN 11
   * modified the pseudo-time stepping linearization for the extra elliptic
     flux in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, subroutine EEF_update_dQtil()
   * modified the pseudo-time step for the extra elliptic equation from
     the max to the min VNN condition in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, subroutine
     EEF_Finddtau()


2004 APR 01
   * changed cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c, to update the fluid flow
     properties everywhere in the domain prior to the first iteration
     - not done when not using the extra elliptic equations
     - necessary to compute the current correctly when solving the electric
       field potential at the boundaries where the velocity is extrapolated
       or fixed to zero after the initial conditions are applied
   * in the definition of EEF_xi part of prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, changed
     it back to its original form, i.e., without normalizing by the conductivity


2004 MAR 31
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, modified the subroutine EEF_Finddtau()
     - fixed a bug concerning how the time step was calculated from the min VNN condition
     - changed the definition of the time step from the min VNN condition to
       the maximum VNN condition
   * modified the subroutine Findj_cartesian in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
   * added four new post variables in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_post.c (i.e. the current at
     each interface)
     - WARNING: this is temporary! needs to be taken away when code is ready to go
             

2004 MAR 30
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c modified the subroutine EEF_UpdateBdryPrim()
     - changed the insulated boundary condition for the electric field potential
       to a second-order accurate extrapolation from the inner nodes
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c, added the subroutine EEF_FindFinterface()
     which computes the term proportional to v_cross_b at the interface
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c, changed the subroutine EEF_FindS()
     and set the source term to zero
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c, added the subroutine EEF_NoFluxThroughBdry()
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, modified the subroutine EEF_update_Res()
     by adding EEF_AddConvRes()
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, added the subroutine EEF_AddConvRes()
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, blanked out the subroutine EEF_ReupdateNearbyBdryNodes()



2004 MAR 29
   * In calculating the residual for the electric field potential (EEF_..),
     now updates the boundary nodes surrounding the inner node everytime
     the residual is computed. Slower, but works well -> this is necessary
     since corner boundary nodes can have two values, depending on the
     direction of the extrapolation
     - modified the subroutine EEF_update_Res in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - modified also the subroutine Findj in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
       to update the surrounding boundary nodes when finding the current
     - added the subroutine EEF_ReupdateNearbyBdryNodes(np_t *np, gl_t *gl, long l);
       in cycle/share/cycle_share.c


2004 MAR 25
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c in the Findj_interface
     subroutine
   * added the additional vcrossB function part of the control file,
     in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
   * in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, added an initialization procedure of the
     terms sigma, betae, betai
   * NOTE: check these bugs:
     - the new findj subroutine doesn't capture perfectly well the current
       when the metrics change a bit -> needs testing
     - reading and writing to the outfile, and reading again causes a change
       in the fluid flow residual
     - having problems converging to machine zero a system in which all boundaries
       for the electric field potential are insulated


2004 MAR 24
   * still modified Findj() subroutine in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c..
     - it's getting better, but some flaw where the current is parallel and
       near the wall where there's high change in metrics
       

2004 MAR 23
   * modified prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c and prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim_source.c
     for new calculation of the psi source term related to v_cross_B
     - NOTE: still some problems though in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c concerning
     the calculation of the current in Findj
     

2004 MAR 22
   * implemented variable conductivity-betae-betai
   * added sigma, betae, betai as post processing output
   * NOTE: there seems to be a bug related to reading and writing datafiles:
           the convergence history changes. Need to check this out.
     NOTE: be careful when assessing the conductivity, betae, betai in between
           nodes: need to clean the code on this point.

2004 MAR 19
   * Continued the modifications to several files to remove some bugs
     related to what has been added on 2004 MAR 18
     

2004 MAR 18
   * made some modifications to src/common.h, src/common.c, and src/bdry.c
     concerning a new NODETYPE, NODETYPE_EEF needed to distinguish between the
     boundary conditions of the extra elliptic equations and the fluid flow
     equations


2004 MAR 03
   * changed the vec_t to EXM_vec_t everywhere
     - got rid of the definition of vec_t in src/common.h

2004 FEB 03
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c, modified the subroutines
     FindSmhd(), EEF_UpdateSourceLinkAtNode(), and EEF_xibardiff()
     in which there was a bug: instead of using the electrical conductivity
     gl->prim.sigma, the CFL-related number gl->sigma was used
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, reinstated the subroutine FindElectricField
     but with a call not including the metrics which are found by the
     subroutine itself
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, got rid of all the Findj subroutines
     that are not used, except for the original Findj subroutine that gave

     vector was found in the subroutines  EEF_UpdateSourceLinkAtNode()
     and EEF_xibardiff()


2004 JAN 31
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.h and prim.c: changed the call to Findj
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c, modified the subroutine
     FindSmhd() so that the source term to the energy equation corresponds exactly
     to the sum of the work and the joule heating at the discrete level, rather
     than to E dot j
   * in file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c, modified the subroutine

   * fixed a bug in cycle/ts/_explicit/ts.c -> used to refer to gl->effiter,
     but is now gl->effiter_Q


2003 JUL 28
   * fixed a bug in src/data.c concerning reading in ascii and binary data files
     when no extra elliptic flux is present (basically, when choosing primFANSkpsi)


2003 JUN 25
   * took away the change in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c so that the EEF
     flux is not solved in multizone mode anymore
     

2003 JUN 18
   * the EEF flux is now solved in multizone mode in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c


2003 APR 14
   * removed the modification made on March 31st.


2003 MAR 31
   * in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c, made a modification to line
     272 to prevent the global iteration on the extra elliptic variable to be
     performed at every iteration in a zone where there's some streamwise ellipticity
     caused by the magnetic field interacting on the flow
     NOTE: NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE!!!!
     

2003 FEB 06
   * moved prim/_WIFANS_kpsi_coupled to experimental (choiceX)


2003 FEB 05
   * there was a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c which prevented the entropy
     correction from being activated if either zetabar1 or zetabar2 were 0
   * in prim/chem/_jachimowsky/chem.c changed the reference to _ResumedNode()
     to NodeResumed() which was part of an assert() command
   * found a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c in the subroutine ROE_FindRoeAtInterface_RoeAverage()
     concerning the calls to the functions _V and _X on the node np for which
     the metrics were not known and initialized.
     - NOTE: need to check/change(?) the file prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c about this


2003 FEB 02
   * Changed the names ONE_SWEEP and DIM_SWEEP to I_SWEEP and IJK_SWEEP
     everywhere in warp
     - makes much more sense
   * added the possibility to have a line-tdma sweep in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - this was done since had some issues with AF for a case in which the grid was
       all screwed up. had nothing to do with AF itself..
     - not sure the line-tdma  sweep really works though.. not too important
     

2003 FEB 01
   * added function EEF_AddDQtoQetilde() in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c to
     put a possible clipping routine in the future: this is called from
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c


2003 JAN 25
   * added a condition in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c so that
     the extra elliptic equation is always updated when EEF_varphi>EEF_varphiverge
     in the marching window: speeds things up when a zone of streamwise ellipticity
     is encountered due to the EEF


2003 JAN 24
   * took away the multizone solver for the extra elliptic equation in
     cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c


2003 JAN 23
   * added a multizone solver for the extra elliptic equation


2003 JAN 22
   * NOTE!!: in src/data.c, need several changes in ReadAscii and WriteAscii
     to include EEF_effiter_R and EEF_effiter_Q
   * changed the purpose of the user-defined constant phi4 in
     cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c
     - now, it controls how many fluid flow iterations are to be performed
       for each global iteration performed on the extra elliptic equations
   * altered src/data.c, src/common.h, src/control.c and cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     to include EEF_effiter_R


2003 JAN 21
   * changed the condition for the upstream boundary of the marching window
     when EEF is in effect to the minimum between Minis (as determined in
     the cycle_share.c module) and the i-station determined as without EEF
   * changed the copyright to include the new year (2003)
   * caught yet another bug in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c
     where the boundary nodes of the eef in the window were not updated
     prior to calculating the residual
     - important to do since the eef boundary nodes depend on the fluid flow
       properties at an insulated surface


2003 JAN 20
   * modified cycle/_standard/cycle.c so that the pseudotime update of Q or efp
     is not performed when the convergence criterion is met
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c where the zones of the multizone
     algorithm were computed when xi>xiverge instead of xibar+xibardiff>xiverge
   * fixed a bug in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c where the UpdateSourceLink
     subroutine was part of an if statement while it should not have been


2003 JAN 18
   * many changes to finalize the implementation of the EEF modifications to
     the marching window cycle, just as is indicated in the JCP paper
     - cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c and cycle/_standard/cycle.c are done
     - NOTE 1: need to alter the other cycles
     - NOTE 2: need the bar variables (Slink, xidiffbar and xibar) to the data file)


2003 JAN 17
   * several changes in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c and
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - now, the residual of the EEF equations is updated after the fluid flow fluxes
       are updated in the marching window
     - should the maximum residual of the EEF equations be less than EEF_xiverge,
       then don't iterate needlessly
     - should speed up the marching window especially for large meshes


2003 JAN 14
   * changed the way the entropy correction term is added to the Roe scheme:
     - it is now added to the eigenvalues "u-a" separately to the eigenvalues "u"
     - does not introduce excessive artificial dissipation in shear layers
       and boundary layers if entropy correction is applied only to "u-a" eigenvalues


2003 JAN 11
   * added a new boundary condition to the prim/_WIFANS_kpsi module: adiatic wall
     with specified phi
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c where the symmetrical boundary
     conditions for phi were badly posed


2003 JAN 10
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c related to the determination of the
     metrics at the boundary node to compute EEF_G


2003 JAN 09
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c


2003 JAN 07
   * added two new boundary conditions in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/


2003 JAN 04
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c where TYPELEVEL_WORK was
     specified when updating the boundary nodes of the extra elliptic flux
     - changed to TYPELEVEL_BASE (of course!)


2003 JAN 03
   * updated the control file output in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_init.c, so
     that it's clear that the last value to be added in the init module
     lines is the electric field potential
   * in the file prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c, changed the name of the module
     from FANSkpsi to WIFANSkpsi (!)


2002 DEC 30
   * a bug fix in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c where the
     updatesourcelink is now performed on window+bb+br instead of
     window+bb only
   * another bug fix in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c where
     the boundary nodes were updated uselessly prior to calculating the
     residual when the marching window expands to the left by more than
     bb+br nodes: the boundary nodes are already updated when being resumed


2002 DEC 28
   * a bug fix in cycle/_marchingwindow_multizone/cycle.c where the
     residual had to be updated when the window was expanded


2002 DEC 27
   * made several modifications to add the VNN in the cycle module:
     - works in the same way as the CFL number, but affects only the extra
       elliptic fluxes for the moment
     - modified cycle/*/cycle.c !!SOME_STILL_TO_BE_DONE!!
     - modified src/control.c src/common.h and src/data.c
     - modified cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * modified quite a bit cycle/share/cycle_share.c so that the scalar
     AF algorithm corresponds exactly to the one outlined in the new
     JCP paper (for the electric field potential equation), with the
     same definition of the pseudo-time step as well


2002 DEC 25
   * modified the definition of _xi() in prim/_WIFANS_KPSI/prim.c to take
     into account all fluid flow fluxes: finally!!


2002 DEC 23
   * changed the definition for _chi() in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
     and the corresponding document in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/MHD/report.tex
     - tested to be identical to previous warp version


2002 DEC 16
   * added a streamwise ellipticity sensor for the EEF equation
     - doesn't seem to help at all: even detrimental!


2002 DEC 14
   * changed the order of the Bdry() and Prim() modules in the control file
     this is necessary if a property across all nodes is to be written to
     the data structure in the prim module (the data structure is initialized
     in the Bdry module)
     - much prettier ;-)
   * cleaned up several function calls in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * modified cycle/_marchingwindow/cycle.c to take into account EEF
   * modified cycle/_multizone/cycle.c to take into account EEF
   * modified cycle/_standard/cycle.c to take into account EEF
   * modified cycle/_sweepingwindow/cycle.c to take into account EEF
   * modified cycle/_sweepingwindow_multizone/cycle.c to take into account EEF


2002 DEC 13
   * A lot of bug fixes all around to make the extra elliptic flux to work
     combined with the marching window. Seems to work now, strangely ;-)
   * included the storage of the magnetic field in every valid node
     in the src/bdry.c module
     - not sure this is elegant!! how about changing the order of things
       in the control file, and putting the Bdry() module before the
       Prim() module? this would permit the magnetic field to be determined
       as part of the prim module, which is more elegant
     - needs to be changed, but tomorrow: need to go home now..


2002 DEC 12
   * so many changes it's not worth noting. Many strange coincidences in my personal
     life happened today: code improvements were minor.. personal life
     improvements? most probably for the best.. life is hard and strange
     sometimes..


2002 DEC 11
   * fixed several bugs in cycle/cycle_share.c and prim/_WIFANS_KPSI related
     to solving the TDMA of the extra elliptic fluxes
   * started the implementation of the "sourcelink" technique, which will
     detect streamwise ellipticity due to the coupling to the electric field
     potential equation


2002 DEC 10
   * implemented many changes to cycle/share/cycle_share.c to take into account
     extra elliptic flux equation


2002 DEC 09
   * renamed the directory prim/_WIFANS_kpsi to prim/_WIFANS_kpsi_coupled
   * created a new directory named prim/_WIFANS_kpsi where the maxwell-related
     equation is uncoupled from the navier-stokes equations
     - this is to permit the application of the marching-window to the WIFANS equations
   * fixed some typos in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c related to the
     reservoir2 boundary condition by jason etele (grrr)
   * replaced all occurences of variables named xtra and xflux in the directory
     prim/_FANS_kpsi by k and psi
   * copied prim/_FANS_kpsi to prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
   * added all the necessary subroutines to tackle an extra elliptic flux (phi)
     in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
   * modified src/data.c and src/common.h to take into account a possible extra
     elliptic flux through the EXTRA_ELLIPTIC_FLUX flag


2002 DEC 06
   * improved the algorithm in cycle/ts/_scalarAF to take into account
     implicit boundary conditions
     - works great, especially with a varying time step!!
     - added a subroutine to find the TDMA coefficient at the boundaries
       in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c


2002 DEC 05
   * modified the LICENSE file
   * added a new directory in cycle/ts/_scalarAF


2002 DEC 04
   * fixed a bug in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c concerning the extrapolation
     of phi on a fixed-phi boundary when using the marching window
   * added the Kenjeres and Hanjalic MHD turbulence correction to
     prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_source.c
     - also upgraded prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/MHD
   * modified the insulated boundary condition for phi in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c
     so that the nearby boundary nodes are not used


2002 DEC 03
   * fixed bug in subroutine FindB(); part of prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
     when theta=0.0
   * fixed two bugs in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c that were caught by
     valgrind
   * upgraded the prim/_FANS_kpsi/ directory to take into account the new
     approach at determining the metrics in the K matrix


2002 DEC 02
   * Implemented the proper FindB() subroutine in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c,
     - includes a sum of the dipoles
     - still a bug to be fixed when theta==0.0
     - included the derivation in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc/MHD/report.tex


2002 NOV 29
   * added a new doc in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc called MHD
   * took away the previous doc subdirectories in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/doc


2002 NOV 28
   * changed the definition of _chi in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim.c
     - this was due to a mistake in the derivation of chi part
       of the document covering the WIFANS governing equations
   * fixed a bug in the Findj() subroutine part of prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - summation was from 1 to nd instead of 1 to 3


2002 NOV 27
   * changed the call to the FindK() subroutine, so that it uses
     the metrics determined at an interface when computing K at a node:
     - necessary to conserve the current on a skewed mesh
   * changed the definition of chi from sigma(n,m) to sigma(m,n): seems
     to work, but doesn't respect the usual rule
     - check this!!!! _checked_
     - there was a mistake in the governing equations in the
       document: corrected now


2002 NOV 26
   * made some modifications to the way phi is extrapolated at the boundary:
     - ensures that the normal component of the current to the wall vanishes
       at a discrete level
     - but! uses nearby boundary nodes: bad bad bad. Needs changes
       but for now, seems to work (NOTE: THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IN THE
       FUTURE  _DONE_)


2002 NOV 23
   * upgraded most boundary conditions to take into account an insulated
     phi at the boundary in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c
     - needs some testing, but tomorrow: let's go home now..


2002 NOV 22
   * changed the call of _dtau to Finddtau where an array is returned
     with nf values for dtau.
     - modified all files in cycle/ts accordingly
   * fixed a few bugs in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
     - the testing continues


2002 NOV 21
   * continued implementation of the Weakly Ionized FANS equations
     in the directory prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
     

2002 NOV 20
   * renamed prim/_FANS_kpsi_MHD to prim/_WIFANS_kpsi
   * several changes to the files in prim/_WIFANS_kpsi to include an extra
     flux for the electric potential


2002 NOV 13
   * added the function krodelta in lib/soap/soap.c
     - also added it to the doc in lib/soap/doc


2002 NOV 02
   * fixed a bug in src/post.c concerning the area_yz function not functioning
     for 1D flows.
     - added a function _Acs() in prim/metrics/_generic/metric.s
     - added the function call _Acs() in prim/_prim.h


2002 NOV 01
   * fixed a bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c concerning calls to the
     function _Omega() in 1D mode
   * added a new prim directory prim/_FANS_kpsi_MHD where some modifications
     are performed to the source terms to account for MHD effects in Smhd


2002 SEP 08
   * added the subdirectory cycle/ts/conv/_AW
   * modified the Roe time stepping scheme in cycle/ts/conv/_Roe
   * put the scheme cycle/res/conv/_YeeRoe_old as experimental (doesn't
     compile)
   * for all subdirectories of cycle/, changed default value for
     IMPLICITBC from FALSE to TRUE


2002 AUG 04
   * fixed a bug concerning the update of the effective iterations
     in cycle/ts/_explicit/ts.c
   * in cycle/res/_generic/res.c, improved the subroutine AddDiffRes()
     by storing in memory K and G
   * in cycle/res/conv/_AW/convres.c, improved the subroutine AddConvRes()
     by computing the interface flux 2 times less
     

2002 AUG 01
   * got rid of _generic module in cycle/res/conv
   * got rid of FindFinterface() subroutines in prim/_FANSkpsi/prim_conv.c
   * modified the Roe subroutines to use the new metrics at the interface
     - modified cycle/res/conv/_Roe/convres.c
     - modifed prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_conv.c
     - modified cycle/ts/conv/_Roe/convts.c
     - modified src/test.c
     - modified cycle/res/conv/YeeRoe/convres.c
   * got rid the the new metrics module in prim/metrics/_2ndOrder
     - made the old metrics module the default, renamed "_generic"


2002 JUL 31
   * added the AW method in cycle/conv/res
   * added a new FindMetricsInterface() subroutine in prim/metrics/
     - makes the scheme perfectly control volume in 2D at least
       * updated AW, need to update Roe and YeeRoe


2002 JUL 08
   * fixed a bug in lib/soap/soap.c, in the subroutine SOAP_CopyCodex()
     where not all the codex variables were being copied
     - this affects the error message when a problem is found in the Runtime()
       module of the control file for example


2002 JUN 08
   * changed the default output to the Post() module, in src/post.c
     - more friendly to a new user

     
2002 JUN 05
   * got rid of iteration reinitialization by the marching-window and
     the sweeping-window in the cycle/*/cycle.c files
     - added a flag in src/main.c called "-reset", to reset the iteration
       count to zero after the data file is read: only to be used in
       UNSTEADY mode when starting a new time step


2002 JUN 04
   * in src/main.c, added a line for UNSTEADY flag (yes or no) when
     calling warp with the -v flag
   * checked the fusina bug concerning -i -im1 and -im2 : couldn't reproduce it.
     - probably a fusina manipulation ``error''
     - let's forget about it..
   * in prim/_prim.h added two new functions called
     - WriteBdryTypes()
     - WriteInitTypes()
     which are called from the src/bdry.c and src/init.c modules
     respectively
     - makes the default WARP control file much prettier, more organized
   * moved the sigma declaration from the Prim() module to the Cycle->Runtime()
     module in the control file
     - this is done so that sigma and CFL are declared at a similar spot
     - sigma should not have been located in the Prim() module since it
       does not affect the residual
     - gives the user the possibility to vary sigma as a function of the
       iteration count
     - modified src/data.c so that sigma is saved in the data files,
       in DATAFORMAT 005
     - if a datafile of DATAFORMAT  004 (or previous) is read, then sigma
       is given a default value of 0.5
   * greatly improved the default control-modules by the cycle/*/cycle.c
     files
     - documents what phi1, phi2, phi3 do, and what xiverge, and varphiverge
       stand for
   * fixed the behaviour of the entrance variable in the marching window
     and sweeping window modules;
     - now, the upstream boundary of the window is such that it is at least
       equal or greater than the entrance
   * in src/post.c, changed all the calls to fatalerror to SOAP_fatalerror,
     so that the line number where the error occurs is outputted


2002 JUN 03
   * in prim/_FANS_kpsi/, made the necessary changes so that in the control
     file, instead of reading in EPSILON=TRUE or FALSE, now it reads in
     the variable PSI which can be set to either PSI_OMEGA or PSI_EPSILON
   * documented the multiple variables in the module PrimFANSkpsi()
   * took away as options for now the new metrics 2ndorder scheme
     and the new YeeRoe scheme. Simplifies the make config process
     greatly


2002 MAY 28
   * added the possibility of not outputting to a file using fprintf
     in lib/soap/soap.c
     - this way, when using MPI, only one process outputs to the file
   * fixed a bug in src/control.c: renamed the function _x() to
     _x_DISTMPI_compatible() which takes into account DISTMPI
     - also affects src/post.c
   * fixed a couple of bugs in the subroutines BA_printf
     and BA_fprintf part of lib/soap/soap.c concerning the screen output:
     basically, all the arguments of printf or fprintf were not being processed
     if not outputting to the screen of to files. This created hang ups
     when using DISTMPI
   * added a flag for SYSTEMCALL in lib/soap/soap.h
     - WARNING: do not use the system() action if using MPI


2002 MAY 27
   * the WriteBodyForcesToFile() action in src/post.c is now MPI
     compatible
   * fixed a bug in FindBodyForces subroutine part of src/post.c
     concerning thetasgn (this affects both the viscous shear and
     the body force)
   * included the parameter q_min when calling Fpot or Pback from
     within the post module of the control file -> set to 1.0 by default
   * fixed a bug in src/post.c where the domain_post was not reset
     properly when the action ResetPostDomain() was called


2002 MAY 26
   * added the include() action in lib/soap/soap.c
     - jasone has waited long enough ;-)


2002 MAY 24
   * cleaned up prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post.c
   * added some new mass flux averaged functions in src/post.c, including
     the mass flux averaged density, pressure, temperature, and speed
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, added the ``system'' action
   * added the action ``fprintf'' to lib/soap/soap.c
   * added some documentation in lib/soap/doc for string handling in SOAP


2002 MAY 23
   * modified src/post.c so that the functions _x(), _y(), and _z() called
     from within the Post() module in the control file apply to the post
     domain, and not to the entire domain as it was done previously
   * fixed a bug in the subroutine SOAP_NumArgum() in lib/soap/soap.c:
     used to return 1 when number of arguments is zero
   * fixed a bug in subroutine _Fpot in src/post.c (did not divide by
     the mass flow rate)
   * changed the call to the function POST_ReversiblyExpandSpeedAndDensityToPressure()
     in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post.c
   * changed the rank of the species in the subroutine _mdotreacting
     part of src/post.c
     - starts counting from 1 instead of 0


2002 MAY 19
   * NOTE: DO NOT USE WARP VERSIONS MAY 12, MAY 13, or MAY 15: BIG BUG
   * inserted a new function ZoneIntersectionOld in src/common.c
     - renamed the calls to ZoneIntersection() to ZoneIntersectionOld
     - ZoneIntersectionOld() corresponds to the old ZoneIntersection()


2002 MAY 15
   * included the additions by Jason Etele in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c
     concerning the Reservoir2 boundary condition


2002 MAY 13
   * almost finished the implementation of the Post(); module functions
     - need to test
     - same note: give access to the postvars defined in prim/_prim.h


2002 MAY 12
   * continued the implementation of the Post(); module functions
     in src/post.c
     - only the mixing efficiency missing
     - note: give access to the postvars defined in prim/_prim.h
   * fixed a bug in src/common.c in function ZoneIntersection()
     - NOTE: this was badly fixed!!, altered again on MAY 19


2002 MAY 02
   * started the necessary modifications to src/post.c to include
     a function calling the thrust potential
     

2002 APR 21
   * fixed a bug in lib/gridg/share.c where the error was not
     returned properly for a FindSegment4 call


2002 APR 14
   * added flag -nox in src/main.c, which also affects
     src/common.c
     - its purpose is to prevent the code from exiting when a fatal
       error is encountered in the subroutine fatalerror(); in
       src/common.c


2002 APR 06
   * in src/test.c, added a new flag to test, i.e. lambdafind,
     which scans through a range of eigenvalues and determines
     the determinant. Very useful to make sure that all eigenvalues
     have been included in the eigenvalue matrix (lambda).


2002 APR 04
   * added the node type check exchange in src/bdry.c, so that the MPI exchange
     will not hang
   * added the broadcasting of SOAP variables in src/control.c


2002 APR 04
   * fixed a bug in src/control.c concerning DISTMPI not reading
     the Grid module (except for process 0).


2002 MAR 22
   * small change to lib/soap/soap.c, where the error message for
     SOAP mentions that the problem is in the vicinity of the line number


2002 MAR 17
   * src/test.c has changed slightly to test the Roe scheme


2002 MAR 14
   * some changes to Vigneron scheme


2002 MAR 10
   * added first-order Roe scheme in cycle/res/conv
   * a few bug fixes to the Vigneron scheme


2002 MAR 07
   * bug fixes to Vigneron scheme..
   

2002 MAR 06
   * added REACTING flag in PrimKpsi() module of the control file
   * added the function ROE_FindQAtNode in prim/ modules.
     - altered the convres modules to use this function
     - makes everything much prettier in cycle/res/conv
   * changed the module name in the control file from PrimKpsi()
     to PrimFANSkpsi()


2002 MAR 05
   * small changes to vigneron scheme (added artificial diffusion)
   * modified the roe related subroutines in prim/
     - altered convres schemes YeeRoe, YeeRoe_old and StegerWarming_3rdorder
     - altered Roe convts scheme
     - altered also src/test.c which made some calls to the roe subroutines
     - WARNING needs checking (checked O.K.)


2002 MAR 02
   * started implementation of the vigneron
     finite difference splitting scheme in prim/_FANS_kpsi
     and cycle/res/conv
   * the constant br_conv has been added to all schemes in
     cycle/res/conv


2002 MAR 01
   * finished implementation of string arithmetic in lib/soap/soap.c


2002 FEB 28
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, fixed the if() command to accept a third
     argument which gets executed if the condition is false
     (i.e. if-then-else now works).
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, fixed the for() command to accept a decreasing
     loop
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, started to implement string arithmetic.
     so far, the operators == and != seem to work. Needs more checking


2002 FEB 26
   * got rid of numclip in the control file modules of cycle/
     also got rid of the ugly function _NumClip in prim/
   * fixed a bug when sending strings as arguments to SOAP_printf function:
     the quotes had to be taken away.
   * fixed a bug in lib/soap concerning strings not being taken into
     account when scanning for the action or function arguments in
     ProcessCode(); function.
   * fixed a bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim.c in subroutine FindClipInfo()
     where a string of 2 bytes was given to strcpy instead of an empty
     string of 1 byte (spotted by valgrind)
   * included FindClipInfo() subroutine in prim/_Euler_entropic,
     prim/_Euler and prim/_Euler_p
   * updated the documentation in cycle/doc for the different cycles


2002 FEB 25
   * in GRIDG library, the error handling should now be complete
     Hurray!!
   * in cycle, changed the variables gl.CFL to CFL, gl.is to window.is,
     etc. Control file is cleaner, easier to read. The gl. used to
     be an indication that the variable ``belonged'' to warp, but
     was confusing to the user.
   * in cycle (all different modules there) changed the call to printf
     in the control file to include clipinfo, and get rid of the
     very ugly PrintClip();
     - still need to change prim/_Euler, prim/_Euler_s and prim/_Euler_P
   * in lib/soap, changed the way SubExprWithStrings was written,
     got rid of many bugs, and can now do some string arithmetic
     kind of..
   * in lib/soap, got rid of a little bug in CleanCode which replaced
     the operators even when inside a string (!=, ==, etc).


2002 FEB 24
   * fixed Runtime() module choking due to line numbering
   * changed some function calls in GRIDG library to return
     and error when error is encountered, instead of just exiting.
     - needs a little bit more work..


2002 FEB 22
   * in the src/post.c file, the WritePrimPostFile() action is altered
     so that when only the name of the post file is given as an argument
     without any xcuts, the domain sent to the WritePrimPost subroutine
     is the entire domain, not a domain of xcuts.
   * in the SOAP library, added line number output when error is encountered
     - still not all finished
     - chokes on Runtime() module
     - in GRIDG library, need to pass the line number to the findsegment 
       subroutine
     - check in src/post.c src/control.c etc. for all calls to fatalerror
       if line number could be outputted for clarity


2002 FEB 21
   * fixed a bug concerning the nodes reallocated in the domain for
     the standard, marchingwindow, sweepingwindow cycles. Used to
     be zone expanded by (bb+br) instead of just (br).
   * in the src/control.c file, made changes to check if
     all the modules are present (and in the correct order) in the
     control file. Finally!


2002 FEB 20
   * reorganized the cycles, in the same order as in the revised
     version of the JCP article


2002 FEB 17
   * okay, the Post() module in the control file seems fully
     operational; who said post-processing was hard?
   * changed the calls to the Scale() action part of gridg
     to have a different scaleing factor along x,y, and x


2002 FEB 11
   * added tom's subsonic outflow boundary condition with constant
     Mach number
     

2002 FEB 08
   * fixed a couple of bugs still in cycle/_activedomain/cycle.c
   * fixed a bug in cycle/_standard/cycle.c concerning #endif DISTMPI
   

2002 FEB 07
   * added Ouflow Mach number boundary condition, BC number 15
     affected files prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim.c and prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c
   * took away the post file module from being written to the
     control file in src/post.c
   * made the size of the marching window domain, active domain and
     sweeping window domain bigger when resuming nodes.
   * fixed a bug in the sweeping window. Basically, the boundary
     nodes (and residual) on the right of the sweeping window were not updated
     correctly.
   * altered quite a bit the active domain algorithm in cycle/_activedomain
     - is almost exactly as specified in AIAA Journal Article by Nakahashi
     - needs testing: do it tomorrow
   * took away subroutine CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx_old in src/post.c
   * added body forces to post module in src/post.c


2002 FEB 06
   * fixed a bug in lib/soap/soap.c concerning substituting
     expressions intertwined between strings
   * continued implementation of the post control file module
     - still need to put in the body forces
     - still need to put in the prim_post integration


2002 FEB 05
   * renamed SOAP_GetArgumStr to SOAP_GetArgumStraight
   * renamed SOAP_GetArgumInt to SOAP_GetArgumLong
   * added SOAP_GetArgumString to the lib/soap library
   * modified src/bdry.c and src/init.c to call SOAP_GetArgumLong
     instead of doing a round(SOAP_GetArgumDouble).
   * further modifications to src/control.c to accept post module
   * modifications to src/post.c for ReadPost subroutine: seems to work


2002 FEB 04
   * in lib/soap/soap.c, changed the way arguments are substituted
     to include the possible substitutions of expressions intertwined
     between strings in one argument


2002 FEB 02
   * started to code up the control fiel post module in
     src/post.c. Now that will make things prettier!
     - still doesn't work though. don't try it.

2002 JAN 31
   * added _Pstag() and _Tstag functions in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim.c,
     and took away _Pstag() in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post_thrustpotential.c
   * added cycle/_activedomain from Nakahashi
   

2002 JAN 29
   * Added contribution to the turbulence production term Pk
     for axisymmetric flow from Etele in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_source.c


2002 JAN 28
   * fixed another bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_source.c
     for axisymmetric source term. Used to be written 4/3 instead
     of 4.0/3.0
   * added the polynomials for the kerosene species in
     prim/thermo/_hightemp/thermo.c from Jason Etele
   * added subroutine dTskdT_from_T() from Jason Etele in
     prim/thermo/_hightemp/thermo.c and prim/thermo/_thermo.h
   * fixed a bug in subroutine dTskdT_from_T() from Jason Etele
     where it was written 1 instead of 1.0
   * update tools/rocket_v2/c to tools/rocket_v4/c from Etele
   * fixed bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_source.c: used to be
     a call to QUASI1D instead of gl->prim.QUASI1D.
     - also affected prim/_Euler_P/prim_source.c


2002 JAN 26
   * fixed a bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_init.c concerning a typo
     #endif#
   * fixed a problem in cycle/_marching/cycle.c that had been introduced
     in WARP version 02jan19: i.e. only the inner nodes must be changed to
     outflow at the window right boundary. The only problem with this
     strategy is that psimin ends up being clipped a lot at the marching
     window right boundary due to a bad wall distance. This does not
     affect the final answer.
     - WARNING: DO NOT USE ANY WARP VERSION FROM 02JAN19 to 02JAN25
   * added Mirror action in the GRIDG library
   * added Scale action in the GRIDG library
   * added ReverseIndex action in the GRIDG library


2002 JAN 25
   * fixed two bugs in src/post.c in subroutine CreateDomainOfCuts
     due to the new standard gl->prim


2002 JAN 24
   * updated prim/_Euler_entropic to the new gl->prim standard
   * updated prim/_Euler_P to the new gl->prim standard
     - finally!!
      

2002 JAN 23
   * got rid of global variables in prim/_Euler and prim/_FANS_kpsi;
     hurray!! they are now all in gl->prim
     - still need to do it in prim/_Euler_P and prim/_Euler_entropic
   * fixed a bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_source.c concerning axisymmetric
     source terms: used to be 2/3, changed to 2.0/3.0. oh no jason!!
     you have to rerun everything..
   * fixed bugs in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_source.c concerning the jacobians
     and source terms with AXISYMMETRIC and QUASI1D flags in them:
     the flags were evaluated for all dimensions, which shouldn't be,
     as they have not been initialized for all dimensions. Luckily,
     this hasn't influenced the behaviour of the code so far..
   * got rid of prim/chem/_generic. Too old and confusing.
   * update prim/chem/ subdirectories for new calls to prim subroutines
     - jachimowski done
     - lutz done
     - none done
     - singh done
   * updated tools/rocket_v2.c from Jason Eteles



2002 JAN 20
   * added some documentation to src/bdry.h
   * got rid of OUTER NODETYPE in src/common.h, this means binary datafiles
     with format 002 cannot be read in anymore. This hasn't been used in more
     than 16 months, so it shouldn't be an issue.
   * changed the protocols for a few functions in src/bdry.h. Affects
     the UpdateNodeType functions which used to specify a zone explicitly,
     with is,ie,js,je,ks,ke. Now, a zone_t variable is used. Much prettier.
   * modified cycle/_marching/cycle.c to work in conjunction with the
     node protocols of src/bdry.h
   * in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_bdry.c, moved FindPrim(); to a more
     global location in UpdateBdryPrim();
   * in all cycle/_?/cycle.c, made the control file variables specified
     by the user part of gl. No more global static variables part of
     cycle.c. Much better!
   * fixed a possible bug in cycle/_marching/cycle.c and cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c
     concerning the user-defined entrance variable not being rounded off
     when inputted from the control file.
   * renamed AF_for_HPACF to AF and the old AF to AF_fast which is being put
     as an experimental module.
     - _AF_for_HPACF is now adopted as the default method: it's a bit slower
       on the x86, but simpifies the configuration..


2002 JAN 19
   * fixed small bug in prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post_thrustpotential.c
     concerning an assertion to gl->DISTDOMAIN (took it away)
   * small modification to cycle/_marching/cycle.c: instead of updating
     only the inner nodes to outflow condition at the right end of
     the marching window, now both the inner and bdry nodes are updated
     to being outflow.


2002 JAN 18
   * took away pentiumpro option in config/config.c
   * finished up implementation of prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post.c to
     integrate viscous stresses: seems to work well, but requires
     a bit of testing


2002 JAN 17
   * added -ieee flag to ccc compiler by default, in config/config.c
   * removed the dependence on -px of -p2 flag in src/main.c
   * changed the copyright years in src/main.c and LICENSE
   * moved prim/_FANS_kpsi/prim_post.c and started a new prim_post
     to integrate viscous stresses at the walls (still not finished)


2002 JAN 15
   * further modifications to prim/Euler_P/prim_source.c


2001 DEC 19
   * added LUTZ chemical solver from Tim Huy


2001 DEC 14
   * added prim/_Euler_P and seems to work well


2001 DEC 10
   * fixed bug in prim/_Euler_entropic/prim_conv.c in FindFProe
   * altered FindRoeAverage in prim/_Euler_entropic/prim_conv.c to
     a simple arithmetic average. Needs work.


2001 DEC 09
   * further improvements to prim/_Euler_entropic
     - still a bug: uniform flow creates a residual


2001 DEC 07
   * further improvements to prim/_Euler_entropic


2001 DEC 05
   * added module prim/_Euler_entropic


2001 DEC 04
   * added module prim/_Euler: constant gamma, inviscid flow


2001 NOV 27
   * added rocket_v2.c in tools/
   * added documentation of rocket_v2 in tools/doc/Rocket_v2
   * added a short README file in tools/ summarizing each tool
     in that directory


2001 NOV 19
   * improved tools/prandtlmeyer.c 


2001 NOV 17
   * added the program prandtlmeyer.c in tools directory to compute
     the geometry of a concave isentropic compression fan


2001 NOV 16
   * improved the performance of CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx() algorithm
     by 100 times or so when doing DISTMPI
   * fixed bug in src/main.c concerning not writing to data file
     when quick (-q) flag is specified
   * altered the output to the screen in src/main.c using block ascii
     characters


2001 NOV 15
   * All calls to MPI_Send have been renamed to
     MPI_IBsend, a built-in function that calls either a non-blocking
     or a blocking sending function (the latter called every 200 calls
     or so)
     - affects src/data.c src/post.c src/common.c src/bdry.c src/init.c
       and src/control.c
   * modified cycle/_multizone/cycle.c and cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c to
     be usable with DISTMPI
   * modified cycle/_standard/cycle.c to report an error when compiled
     with DISTMPI
   * fixed a bug in cycle/_marching/cycle.c concerning the UpdateBdryNodes
     part of ResizeMarchingWindow
   * fixed a bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning ResumeNodesInZone
     and not enough memory allocated to noderes and bdryres
   * fixed a bug in src/post.c in CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx()


2001 NOV 14
   * moved subroutine CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx from src/common.c to
     src/post.c where it belongs (it is used only for post-processing
     purposes)
   * modified cycle/share/cycle_share.c so that the number of effective
     iterations in each process is taken as the maximum effective iterations
     spent in any process: afterall, the effective iterations is a number
     supposed to represent the total work accomplished, which in the
     case of an MPI formulation is really the maximum between each
     process.
   * modified CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx() subroutine to be usable with MPI
   * included the flag DISTDOMAIN in gl_t, that is TRUE for the normal
     nodes, but FALSE for the domain of x-cuts
   * changed the output to the screen (warp -v) in src/main.c


2001 NOV 13
   * altered src/bdry.c to make ShowNodeType DISTMPI compatible
   * fixed bug in src/common.c regarding subroutine NodeRank
   * in src/control.c, took away the local np and gl data initialization
     after the grid generation. Rather, it now calls InitDataStructure
     part of src/common.c, which is also used by CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx
     in src/common.c
   * fixed bugs in src/common.c for CreateDomainOfCutsAlongx, now
     seems to work fine but not with DISTMPI yet.


2001 NOV 12
   * altered src/post.c to make it compatible with distributed memory
     MPI
   * changed the calls from MPI_Send to MPI_Ssend in src/data.c
     and src/post.c when writing to data files. This creates a blocking
     which speeds up considerably writing to the data file
   * modified the transfer of the grid to be faster in src/control.c


2001 NOV 10
   * fixed 2 bugs in prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c that would have appeared
     only in 1D anyway
   * included #include <src/bdry.h> in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * improved efficiency of grid broadcasting and reading data file
   * altered reading and writing ascii data files subroutines
     for DISTMPI use
   * modified src/control.c to call DomainNeededFromDomain() and
     DomainFromRank() in src/common.c, related to DISTMPI


2001 NOV 09
   * modified src/control.c so that only process 0 generates the
     grid and broadcasts it to the other processes. A bit slow though..


2001 NOV 08
   * changed domain_needed to bb+br+2 from bb+br+1 in src/control.c
     (possibility of memory corruption there I think)
   * modified src/control.c to forbid the gridg library from
     outputting to the screen when rank!=0


2001 NOV 07
   * changed prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c for the inlet config


2001 NOV 06
   * fixed several bugs in cycle/_marching/cycle.c and
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c for DISTMPI implementation. It seems
     to be working great now in 2D at least.


2001 NOV 05
   * modified src/data.c to read and write binary files in MPI mode;
     - still needs some modifications for ascii read and write though
     - could need some cleaning up
   * fixed bug in SweepWith1DSegments in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * fixed several bugs in cycle/_marching/cycle.c


2001 NOV 04
   * limit the nodes being adjusted in AdjustNodeType part of
     src/bdry.c so that no violation of memory occurs
   * fixed bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning DISTMPI
     in SolveMultizone
   * took away the DISTMPI from FindXimax in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     and put it in cycle/_marching/cycle.c
   * modified src/data.c for MPI read, not FINISHED


2001 NOV 03
   * transfered the subroutines affecting the positions of the boundary
     nodes in src/bdry.c from src/common.c
   * modified the calls to AdjustNodeType in cycle/_marching/cycle.c
     and in src/control.c
   * modified config/config.c and added the choices between distributed
     and non-distributed MPI strategies
   * renamed the non-distributed MPI flag to SHAREDMPI flag
   * added MPI commands for DISTMPI
   * when DISTMPI flag is set, the domain is automatically split into
     the number of processes in src/control.c


2001 NOV 02
   * made several changes to the subroutines in src to make it possible
     to run a case with the domain js set to 10. Works well in 2D
     - Need to test more, especially a cut.
     - altered cycle/_marching/cycle.c in ResizeMarchingWindow
     - NOTE: check the sweeping cycle, standard, and multizone cycle.c
       files for the same changes


2001 NOV 01
   * NOTE: officially started the distributed memory coding. All subsequent
     versions must be taken with a grain of salt until further notice.
   * moved the FindxyzBdry subroutine to the gridg library, where
     it belongs
     - needs some testing.
     - need to modify the FindCutAlongx subroutine in src/common.c
       and InitDataStruct subroutine as well
   * got rid of numxnodes, and replaced with the gl->domain_needed
     - also introduced here gl->domain_whole, to be used later on
       for distributed memory MPI


2001 OCT 31
   * added the revised prim/chem/_jachimowsky/chem.c file from
     Tim Huy: includes the analytical jacobian that works
   * added the lutz chemical model, at this stage, perfectly
     equal to the jachimowsky model
   * added dskdT_from_T function in prim/thermo/_hightemp


2001 OCT 29
   * added a modification to the Approximate factorization time
     stepping to reduce the mallocs made: called it _AF_for_HPACF


2001 OCT 25
   * increased the precision of the double precision numbers in src/post.c
     outputted to the grid file: fixes an issue in tecplot.
     Purely affects the post-processing file though, not the data files.


2001 OCT 23
   * added an example for prim_post.c (easier to read and understand
     than the original). the example is named
     prim/_kpsi/prim_post_example.c


2001 OCT 11
   * fixed bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning the residual
     not broadcasted after the SHAREDMPI loop


2001 OCT 08
   * fixed in common.c CreateDomainOfCuts to allow it to tackle
     only one cut. Very handy!
   * renamed functions in common.c _ValidNode to NodeValid,
     _ResumedNode to NodeResumed, etc: clearer.

   * modified prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c so that the integration
     goes through the entire domain, including the is and ie
     boundaries


2001 OCT 07
   * implemented the -px flag in main.c: works great!, and enables
     the user to cut the domain at certain x stations, which are
     afterwards outputted to the postfile
     - only an xstation which cuts through all i lines is valid
     - a minimum of 3 xstations is necessary
   * modified prim/metrics/_2ndOrder/metrics.c to revert to a
     first order accurate backward stencil to find dxdX when
     the second order accurate stencil induces a negative Jinv


2001 OCT 06
   * made the NODETYPE_ flags in src/common.h: makes many things
     much more readable
   * modified prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c perform some cuts along x
     prior to finding the integrated properties.
     o needs some more work.
     o -p2 flag is unusable with this version


2001 OCT 05
   * reverted to old convection ts method _Roe as the default and
     renamed the new one _Roe_new, as experimental


2001 OCT 04
   * added new convection ts method _Roe, and renamed the previous
     _Roe to _Roe_old for backward compatibility
   * moved subroutine AddConvJac from cycle/ts/share/ts_share.c to
     cycle/ts/conv/_Roe/convts.c
   * fixed bug in src/post.c, which did not bound the post region
     within the domain limits correctly
   * bugs in cycle/ts/_MAF and cycle/ts/_MAFk, where TYPELEVEL
     was wrongly typed in as NODETYPE.


2001 OCT 03
   * fixed a bug in lib/gridg/share.c, concerning exiting GRIDG
     when eps is not finite
   * fixed a bug in prim/metrics/_2ndOrder/metrics.c, concerning
     the determination of Jinv in 3D
   * in lib/gridg/2Dbase.c and lib/gridg/3Dbase.c, modified the Block
     subroutine in such a way that the NO segments do not need to
     be specified anymore: by setting i1=i2, it is implicit that
     no segment is desired along i, and hence no segment needs to
     be listed in the arguments.
     - needs further testing, but seems bug free for now
     - grid generation is much prettier now


2001 OCT 02
   * some changes to tools/injector.c
   * modified all files that included a function calling for a
     node type BASE, being TRUE or FALSE; this is now changed
     to specifying either TYPELEVEL_BASE or TYPELEVEL_WORK.
   * in prim/_kpsi/prim.c, in the function FindQtilde, FindQtilde2,
     etc, now checks whether the node is resumed before writing
     to wk->.


2001 OCT 01
   * fixed a bug in the prim/metrics/Makefile: the directory
     _2ndOrder was not included in the make cleanall
   * in lib/exm/exm.h, took away the #ifndef TRUE line:
     created a problem when compiling on a TRU64 OS with
     the default cc compiler.
     - removed the definition of mod and bool in soap.h
       and soap.c
     - the ifndef was needed if one wished to use both
       the soap and exm libraries at the same time,
       each of them declaring the bool type.
   * changed prim/metrics/_2ndOrder/metrics.c so that WARP
     exits ONLY when Jinv is negative AND the node is valid
     (with _ValidNode). It used to be set up so that WARP
     exits every time Jinv is negative.
     - this change should not be necessary however..
   * fixed a bug in lib/gridg/share.c which created the infamous
     'problem finding root'. Grid generation should be much easier
     on the end-user now..
   * in lib/gridg/xDbase, altered the size command to initialize
     the grid to a unit cube after it has been malloc'ed.
   * put tools/scripts and tools/predictions into one single
     directory (tools)
   * changed the behaviour of the -v flag in main.c: it is now
     only used to print out the version of the code along with
     some other info.


2001 SEP 30
   * included the tarwarp bash script in the directory tools/scripts


2001 SEP 26
   * fixed a small but in cycle/share/cycle_share.c concerning SHAREDMPI:
     - related to the changes in cycle with the zone struct replacing
       is,js,ks, ie,je,ke
   * added the compilation date, and version number in src/main.c
   * renamed SymTVDYee to YeeRoe_old in cycle/res/conv
   * created two directories for documentation in prim/metrics/doc
     and cycle/res/conv/doc, and altered appropriate Makefiles
   * implemented prim/metrics/_2ndOrder, with the old metrics
     renamed to prim/metrics/_2ndOrder_old
     - the YeeRoe scheme now works super on the boundaries.
     - still needs to be tested in 3D though
   * fixed a bug in src/post.c, in tecplot module in 3D


2001 SEP 25
   * changed some code in tools/predictions/inletgeom.c: works great
     now
   * fixed bug in src/main.c, converning post region command in 2D
   * modified slightly src/post.c, made it more elegant with zone
     and subzone


2001 SEP 24
   * moved lib/propulsion/propulsion.c and lib/propulsion/propulsion.h
     to tools/predictions/share.c and tools/predictions/share.h


2001 SEP 23
   * incorporated the zone concept in cycle/share
     - much cleaner interface to most subroutines in cycle_share
     - gl now has a 'domain' zone and a 'window' zone that replace
       gl.ais and gl.is respectively
     - since this affects a LOT of files, needs further testing


2001 SEP 08
   * in cycle/_marching/cycle.c and cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c,
     initialized wk->Res[flux] to 0.0e0, at the same time
     as wk->xi. Otherwise, this might give a problem on
     the alpha platform.


2001 SEP 07
   * in src/data.c, in the subroutine WriteDataFile, added
     a rename file before writing to data file.
     - just in case the job gets killed while writing..
   * commented out in cycle/share/cycle_share.c SMALLTHREADS:
     - it's necessary for stability on hpacf
   * added the function "defined" in lib/soap/soap.c


2001 SEP 06
   * some changes to cycle/share/cycle_share.c to speed up the SHAREDMPI,
     by threading the updateQtildeFromQ but not UpdateBdry


2001 SEP 05
   * fixed bug concerning xi. It originated from the marching
     cycle and sweeping cycle files, and were due to an initialization
     of Res[flux] instead of xi to zero, in the subroutine
     ResizeMarchingWindow.
   * fixed SHAREDMPI bug in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, concerning xi,
     which is not broadcasted along with the residual
     - maybe the residual does not need to be broadcasted. Only
       xi really matters. Needs some research, but is minor.
   * reset maxzonethread to 16 from 32 in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - this might improve the stability of the threads
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, added the condition SMALLTHREADS
     if turned on, the boundary nodes and UpdateDQtilde.. will be
     threaded. Turned off by default.


2001 SEP 04
   * initialize xi to -10e99 when resuming nodes: this clears a problem
     appearing on the alpha chip in cycle_share.c, when comparing
     xi (which could be not a finite quantity) to a finite quantity.
     - note that this is NOT a bug fix, just a workaround, the
       xi bug needs to be figured out (only appears in the marching
       cycle)


2001 AUG 29
   * Implemented the YeeRoe scheme in cycle/res/conv.
     - differs from the previous Roe-symmetTVD-Yee scheme by respecting
       the characteristics at the boundaries
     - needs to be tested more, check if it conserves freestream,
       and adjust the metrics at the boundaries
     - can be made 2 times faster by storing in RAM Fint


2001 AUG 27
   * The species ordering is now defined at compile time
     - the ordering cannot be changed in the control file anymore
     - no more DefineSpecies in control file, and in thermo module
     - the config.c config file generator has been changed and
       asks the user for the species should no chemical model be
       used (chem=null)
     - upon executing warp -v, the user is given the species ordering,
       as it has been specified at compile time
     - upon executing warp -w control.file, at the top of the control
       file, the species ordering (as specified at compile time) is
       listed.


2001 AUG 10
   * implementation of IMPLICITBC part of ts.c. Affects all ts.c
     and ts_share.c
   * _xi is now called part of the residual. This should speed
     things up in a parallel environment (either threads or SHAREDMPI)
     and also in the situations where only a few zones are computed
   * the species ordering is now fixed at compile time, ordered
     by the chemistry modules (makes more sense from a chemistry
     point of view)
     - need to change the _null module to ask the user at compile
       time for some species


2001 AUG 09
   * implementation of PRECONDITIONING flag in control file, affects
     all cycle.c modules and ts.c modules


2001 AUG 02
   * further improvements to prim/_kpsi/doc/Performance


2001 JUL 31
   * further improvements to the doc prim/_kpsi/doc/Performance


2001 JUL 27
   * put prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c back to how it was before, with
     the correct constants for the injectors2 flowfield
   * got rid of MLOCK and TEST questions in config/config.c
   * changed name of gl->nn_lock to gl->lock
   * zone threads now support UpdateQtildeFromDQtilde and
     UpdateBdryNodes in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - NOTE: I wonder if these threads are too short, which
       might bug the kernel 2.4 on fe02. Needs testing.
   * got rid of M_PI in lib/exm and lib/soap, since it is not
     ANSI C compliant


2001 JUL 26
   * changed config/config.c: it now prompts for a choice of compiler,
     and the interface has been cleaned up a bit
   * all the fatal errors are now through the fatalerror() function
     in src/common.c. No more exit() anywhere in WARP, except for
     the libraries
   * added a fflush(stdout); at the end of the SOAP_printf command
     in lib/soap/printf.c


2001 JUl 25
   * improved the calling syntax for SweepWith1DSegments: much MUCH
     cleaner now. This affects several files in cycle/res and cycle/ts.


2001 JUL 20
   * got rid of SweepWith1DSegments_old everywhere. Hurray!


2001 JUL 19
   * copied SweepWith1DSegments to SweepWith1DSegments_old
     everywhere
   * changed SweepWith1DSegments in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     so that the segments to be altered are now from is to ie
     inclusive as opposed to is to ie non-inclusive, which
     created some confusion
   * altered all files in cycle/ts which called SweepWith1DSegments
     - NOTE: this must be done for all files in the cycle/res as well
   * fixed bugs in cycle/ts/_MAF and cycle/ts/_MAFk which prevented
     them from being used in a multizone environment


2001 JUL 18
   * got rid of extstdio library and all the hassle it represented
   * made config/config.c completely independant of the libraries


2001 JUL 17
   * addition of SHAREDMPI command in cycle/share/cycle_share.c,
     src/main.c and src/common.h
   * addition of SHAREDMPI commands in src/data.c and src/post.c
     to prevent all processes from writing to the outfile/postfile
     at once.
   * addition of wfprintf function in src/common.c, which is called
     instead of the fprintf function everywhere in WARP


2001 JUL 13
   * fixed another misunderstanding in prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c, where
     the thrust potential is not evaluated if the stagnation pressure
     is lower than the pressure at the exit (Pstarc).
   * changed the system call to printf by including a printf.c
     module in lib/soap. The module is based on the code by the FSF
     for the system call printf. The system call from within WARP
     is not compatible with SHAREDMPI and should be avoided.


2001 JUL 12
   * changed the name to WARP, Window Allocatable Resolver for Propulsion
   * fixed a misunderstanding in prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c: when integrating
     Fpot along a streamline, if the speed drops below zero, better
     to just ignore that streamline
   * changed string THREADED to THREADS everywhere
   * fixed a bug for 1D formulation in src/control.c, and
     another one in prim/_kpsi/prim_conv.c


2001 JUL 11
   * amelioration of module prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c


2001 JUL 10
   * implementation of new high-temp stagnation pressure and thrust
     potential in prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c


2001 JUL 05
   * little enhancements to performance parameters document in 
     prim/_kpsi/doc/Performance


2001 JUN 29
   * Added EXM_NumInteg and EXM_NumDiff subroutines to the exm library


2001 JUN 28
   * Added a zone trimmer, for the determination of the residual. Results
     in reduced CPU time and much better zone threading.
   * zone threading works well now.
   * added a numthread optimizer in cycle/share/cycle_share.c


2001 JUN 26
   * Incorporated the SetupZones and SolveZones subroutines in 
     cycle/share/cycle_share.c, and called those from cycle.c in all
     cycle modules using multizone
   * Moved UpdateBdryNodes, SweepWith1DSegments to cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * all the loop threading is now in cycle/share/cycle_share.c
   * got rid of the UpdateBdryNodes call from src/post.c and 
     prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c. Not needed anymore.
   * got rid of function ClockSpeed in common.c
   * modified config/config.c exchanging THREADED flag to ZONETHREADS
     and LOOPTHREADS flags


2001 JUN 25
   * cleaned up the documentation in cycle/doc to include only the
     domain decomposition algorithms and not the full article sent
     to the jcp.
   * renamed extmaths library to exm library
   * changed the names of the functions and data types in exm library
     to be preceded by EXM_ string. 
   * renamed gridgen library to gridg and added the prefix GRIDG_
     to all its external functions
   * added prefix SOAP_ to all external functions of the soap library


2001 JUN 23
   * moved the -f flag (frequency of WriteDataFile call) to being
     handled by the Runtime() module inside the control file.
     - altered cycle/_marching/cycle.c, cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c,
       cycle/_standard/cycle.c and cycle/_multizone/cycle.c
     - altered cycle/share/cycle_share.c
     - modified main.c extensively. A bit more readable now.
   * some further modifications to prim/_kpsi/doc/Performance
     document.


2001 JUN 22
   * added some error handling screen outputs in case
     a malloc call returns NULL in common.c


2001 JUN 21
   * included a document related to performance in
     prim/_kpsi/doc/performance


2001 JUN 14
   * removed the individual documentation of each cycle strategy
     and replaced by the article submitted to the JCP in cycle/doc


2001 JUN 13
   * finished implementing MAFk: works great
     - k is set to 2 permanently: the source must be modified to
       change it
   * combined all the docs in cycle/ts and made one document
     which is put in cycle/ts/doc
   * changed the global variables in prim/_kpsi to include the
     prefix extern


2001 JUN 11
   * changed the way the stagnation pressure is determined in 
     prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c to include the effect of a varying gamma
   * added bibliography databases in form nasa.bib, aiaa.bib, etc.
     in /lib/latex
 

2001 JUN 10
   * completed the documentation of MAF and MAF(k) methods in
     cycle/ts/_MAFk/doc


2001 JUN 06
   * added the psi variable in the initvars, part of prim/_kpsi/prim_init.c
     - the control file changes, in the init module. 
     - note that psi used to be automatically determined from the flow speed
       as psi=10*q


2001 JUN 03
   * fixed a bug in prim/_kpsi/prim_bdry.c in FindDwall: loop went to
     ns instead of nf.
   * incorporated PrintClip(FILE) function in prim/_kpsi/prim.c to print
     to FILE the properties clipped (like kmin, kmax, etc)
   * altered cycle/_marching/cycle.c, cycle/_multizone/cycle.c,
     cycle/_standard/cycle.c and cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c, changing
     the template written to the control file to take into account
     PrintClip();. Also got rid of some initialization to *codex,
     which is put in cycle/share/cycle_share.c 
   * in cycle/share/cycle_share.c, reset the number of clips after
     each time Runtime is called. Some will like this one!
   * included a new directory cycle/ts/share, with the linearization
     jacobians in there
 


2001 JUN 02
   * stabilized MAF: simply changing the convection linearization from
     the one proposed by MacCormack to the one used previously fixed
     the problem
     - fixed a bug in ts.c concerning the (wrong) non-update
       of dQtilde at the boundary nodes.
   * fixed a bug in cycle/ts/_approxfact/ts.c concerning the 
     non-update of dQtilde at the boundary nodes: only affects if
     BCs are implicit.
   * fixed a bug in lib/extmaths/extmaths.c


2001 JUN 01
   * continued implementation of MAF: still not very stable at CFL>1;
     strange.
   * implemented SolveTDMABlockAndCheck in lib/extmaths/extmaths.c
     to verify the exactness of the TDMA solver.
   * added third order terms to flux discretization in
     cycle/res/conv/_StegerWarming-FVS/convres.c
    

2001 MAY 31
   * fixed a bug in cycle/_sweeping/cycle.c, cycle/_standard/cycle.c
     and cycle/_multizone/cycle.c concerning copung codexcontrol
     to codex after the init module is called.
   * took away Vbig and omega post-processing variables (the last
     two) in prim/_kpsi/prim.c and prim/_kpsi/prim.hh


2001 MAY 28
   * changed the way the control file is read: everything now
     is read sequentially, one module after the other, as opposed
     to the previous ugly RXread functions (beurk!)
     - note that this affects the control file slightly, i.e.
          no more -initu flag and 'Unconditional' section. Simply
          insert the portion of the initial conditions after
          the ReadDatafile(); command for these to take effect
          after the data files have been read
   * implemented the _x, _y and _z global functions that
     can be used in all modules (except Runtime). Very handy
     for setting up fancy initial conditions.
   * changed the screen output of control.c
   * started implementation of MAF: still unstable


2001 MAY 17
   * fixed a small error in cH2S, the stoichiometric
     mass fraction of H2, part of prim/_kpsi/prim_post.c


2001 MAY 15
   * fixed a bug in prim/_kpsi/prim_bdry.c that affects the metrics
     computed for boundary node #9 (symmetrical first-order,
     momentum preserved)
   * added two new boundary conditions in prim/_kpsi/prim_bdry.c
     i.e. Euler slip wall first and second order
   * altered src/common.c in ShowNodeType subroutine to enable
     the correct printout of boundary nodes numbered higher
     than 9 as A, B, C, etc..
   * added the 3-part segment type in the lib/gridgen library and
     documented it in lib/gridgen/doc


2001 MAY 13
   * took away momentum contribution in _xi part of 
     prim/_kpsi/prim.c
   * split the prim.c file into several files in prim/_kpsi
   * added a minmod in cycle/res/conv/_generic: doesn't work
     too well: needs work


2001 MAY 12
   * in the marching and sweeping cycles, fixed bug concerning
     the entrance parameter (i.e. the window would not advance
     past the entrance point).


2001 MAY 06
   * included the momentum residual contribution in _xi part
     of prim/_kpsi/prim.c
   * included FindFinterface and _phi in prim/_kpsi/prim.c
   * included the generic convective flux solver in
     cycle/res/conv/_generic
   * renamed symmetTVD to Roe-symmetTVD and symmetTVD-Yee
     to Roe-symmetTVD-Yee in cycle/res/conv
   * added the directory prim/_kpsi_tmp to test eigenvalues


2001 APR 10
   * fixed bug in lib/extmaths/extmaths.c
     - the array *TMP size was determined by the function calling
       solve_TDMA_block and solve_PDMA_block
     - The size of *TMP is now fixed to 6 and declared locally.
     - affected the multizone decomposition when very small loops
       were used (ie-is<3).


2001 APR 09
   * fixed bug in cycle/*/cycle.c related to codex.FUNCTION=FALSE,
     codex.ACTION=FALSE, etc..
     - NJAMD doesn't complain anymore.


2001 APR 08
   * fixed warnings given by ccc (compaq c compiler)
     - included the inclusion of #include <string.h> in extstdio.h
   * fixed warnings given by AIX cc
     - use of // for a comment in extmaths.c
   * from the electric fence utility, malloc read/write over/underaccess
     were fixed
     - in cycle/ts/_approxfact/ts.c, maxnumb is taken from
       le minus ls as opposed to from gl.is, gl.js, etc.
     - in soap.c, at two places, the algorithm was trying to illegally
       read from ram not allocated (underread)
   * lib/memwatch has been taken away permanently
   * all libraries and common.h now include the file lib/include/memdebug.h
     - to be used in conjunction with the memwatch or MSS packages
     - just add the proper lines in there that you wish are included in
       all files of the project


2001 APR 04
   * incorporated a nan check in prim/hightemp/thermo.c


2001 APR 03
   * changed the default optimization level to 2 instead of 4
     - level 4 creates some problems with gcc (sometimes):
       use it at your own risk!!
     - optimization level 4 results in an executable which
       goes 2 times faster than level 2 though: but it affects
       mostly lib/extmaths/extmaths.c; therefore, just compiling
       extmaths.c with -O4 will give excellent results
   * all output to the screen (from the cycle.c files) is now
     the responsibility of the user in the control file
     - access to the necessary variables (like the number of zones,
       ximax, etc) is now possible for all cycles.


2001 MAR 28
   * addition of printf command in libsoap
     - same syntax as in C or the system printf command
       except for the \" command which is not supported in soap (yet).
