FLAG           ARGUMENT                                      Required?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-filename      '*.c' or '*Makefile' or '*.wrp' or '.config'  N 
-git           No argument. If set, will include files       N
               within .git directories.
-w             No argument. If set, will only replace the    N
               string if it is a word.
-i             No argument. If set, will do a case           N
               insensitive search.


EXAMPLES
 
${0##*/} -w 'John' -filename '*.c'
will search within all *.c files recursively for the word John and write out the name of the files that contain such a word

${0##*/} -i -git 'John' 
will search within all files including those within .git directories recursively for the string John (case insensitive) and write out the name of the files that contain such a string


SPECIAL CHARACTERS

  ! must be escaped as \!
  ' must be written as '\''  or as '\"'\"'
