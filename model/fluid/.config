help     For a non-ionized gas, choose either "Navier-Stokes perfect" (calorically perfect), or "Navier-Stokes" (multispecies real gas with the species enthalpies determined from the NASA Glenn polynomials),  or "Favre-Reynolds" (multispecies real gas including various k-omega and k-epsilon turbulence models). For an ionized gas, choose "drift-diffusion" for the drift-diffusion plasma model (neutrals at rest), or the modules denoted with "plasma" (neutrals in motion).
